     (0) NOTICE

          Please read this file carefully before trying to set up Xastir.
          This software was developed to be used by licensed amateur radio
          operators.  You are responsible for any information transmitted
          or propagated on any network.

     (1) WHAT IS XASTIR?

          Xastir is an open-source project to create a free X11 graphical
          APRS(tm) client. APRS(tm) use amateur radio and Internet services to
          convey GPS mapping, weather, and positional data in a graphical
          application.  It has been developed by and for amateur radio
          enthusiasts to provide real-time data in an easy to use package.

          Xastir currently runs under several flavors of Linux and BSD Unix.
          A few people are running Xastir on Solaris Unix, FreeBSD, Lindows
          and Mac OS X, but there may be small changes necessary in order to
          get Xastir to configure/compile on some systems.  There are a few
          notes below which may help in this task.  Most of the developers use
          Linux which makes it the best supported platform at the moment.

          Xastir is an open-source project: Most sources, documentation, and
          binaries are available under the GPL license, with a few modules
          available under other open-source or public domain licenses.

          More information on Xastir can be found at:

            http://www.xastir.org
            http://xastir.sourceforge.net
            http://sourceforge.net/projects/xastir/

          including the latest releases, the anonymous CVS access (lets you
          download the latest developers' code), and information on how to join
          Xastir mailing lists.

          SmartBeaconing(tm) was invented by Tony Arnerich (KD7TA) and Steve
          Bragg (KA9MVA) for the HamHUD project.  They offer the algorithm to
          other authors as long as proper credit is given and the term
          SmartBeaconing(tm) is used.  Thanks to Tony and Steve for that
          contribution!

             -- The Xastir Group.

     (2) HOW TO GET XASTIR

          Xastir is currently developed at
          <http://sourceforge.net/projects/xastir/>
          You can get the latest version of Xastir from there.

          You might try www.xastir.org for help and information.
          The web site is:
          <http://xastir.sourceforge.net>.


     (2a) CVS USAGE

          You might obtain the *very latest* version of Xastir that
          is still under development by using CVS. 
          
          See the file README.CVS for more details.

     (3) QUICK STARTUP

           INCLUDED IN 'INSTALL'
           WINDOWS USERS:  Please refer to the "README.win32" file for specific
           instructions.

     (4) UPGRADING

           INCLUDED IN 'UPGRADE'

     (5) IDENTIFICATION NOTES
          Packet radio modes, by their very nature, typically identify
          themselves with every transmission. Xastir has a few features
          targeted to people who used Xastir in demonstrations and other
          broadcasts where Xastir itself is used over radio.

          Xastir can auto-ID via voice if Festival is compiled in and/or via a
          message splashed across the screen. It does this identification
          every 9.5 minutes if enabled. These identification modes were
          designed for broadcasting Xastir across fast-scan television (for
          events perhaps). Set the "ATV_SCREEN_ID" variable to 1 to enable the
          screen message, and "SPEAK_ID" variable to 1 to enable festival to
          speak the message. These variables are in the
          ~/.xastir/config/xastir.cnf file.


     (6) OS SPECIFIC NOTES
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      MAC OSX NOTES:

     No changes necessary now for Mac OS X!

     If you intend to run with GDAL installed, you may find that geotiff
     projection doesn't work. To avoid this, install libtiff, libproj,
     and libgeotiff first, then configure GDAL with 
     --with-libtiff=/path/to/libtiff --with-geotiff=/path/to/geotiff
     It's important to not choose "yes" or "internal". You may also want
     --with-libz=yes

     If you have trouble building GDAL you may need this patch:

     You may want to install everything to /sw though, so that the normal
     user can find it easily and add maps.  To do this, run this instead:

        ./configure --prefix=/sw

     That will cause Xastir to be installed in /sw/xastir/* directories, and
     the executable will go into /sw/bin/xastir.

     Ports have been contributed to DarwinPorts. This will be updated with
     instructions when those are committed.

     Here's a web page which has specific instructions for installing on OSX,
     including a binary version of Xastir (no compiling necessary):

       END OF MAC OSX NOTES.
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------


     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       FreeBSD NOTES:

     There are both a binary package and a port available as part of the
     official FreeBSD ports system.  Most FreeBSD users can either type
     "pkg_add -r xastir" which will fetch the relevant binary for their
     release, or preferably update their ports tree and use the port to get
     the latest version.

     Other options:

     The FreeBSD port of xastir uses a development snapshot, and not
     necessarily the latest snapshot, depending on how busy the port
     maintainer is.  If you wish to be on the bleeding edge you can build
     xastir yourself from the latest development snapshot or from CVS,
     without much more difficulty than Linux users have.  There are a few
     caveats, though.

     The version of autoconf used to generate configuration files for
     Xastir is 2.57 or later.  If you have autoconf 2.13 installed,
     there will be difficulties if you try to run "bootstrap.sh."  It
     is best to install recent, matching versions of autoconf and automake
     directly from sources into a separate binary directory other than
     /usr/local/bin, without relying on the FreeBSD ports system.  The 
     ports system installs autoconf and automake with odd suffixes that
     can interfere with the xastir build process.

     Contact Jack Twilley <jmt@twilley.org> or Tom Russo <russo@bogodyn.org> 
     for more help in getting Xastir configured and built under FreeBSD.

       SOLARIS NOTES:

     Changes required for Solaris 2.5 -> 7.0.  Other versions may require
     slightly different changes.

     After running "configure", edit src/Makefile and make these changes:

       Solaris 2.5 -> 2.6:
         NOTE: Solaris 2.5 -> 2.6 do not install Xpm.  If you've installed it
         you'll need to delete "-DNO_XPM" from src/Makefile, make sure the
         headers are in the search path, and add "-lXpm" to the LIBS or
         LDFLAGS line in src/Makefile.

       Solaris 7.0 notes from Chris Bell:
       ----------------------------------
         Date: Fri, 11 Jan 2002 16:38:57 -0800
         From: Chris Bell <cbell@junknet.com>

         Subject: Re: [Xastir-Dev] Autoconf fixes for various OS's 

         YAY!!! Xpm is properly detected for solaris7!!!!  On my system, (with
         geotiff and ImageMagick) I still have to tweak the geotiff detection
         to avoid the system libtiff:

           cat > conftest.$ac_ext <<EOF
           #line 4992 "configure"
           #include "confdefs.h"
 
         Also, the generated Makefile needs the -L/usr/local/lib
         -R/usr/local/lib added, and -lposix4 added to the link lib line.
 
         It is compiling now, I will let you know if there are any runtime
         problems.  
 
         I also installed the latest patches for the OS... the latest
         Openwindows patch finally fixes the X header warnings, so we don't
         have to fear turning -Wall back on.  (patch # 108376-33) Probably a
         good tidbit for the README...
 
         I am trying to get enough parts to build more systems for testing
         solaris 8.   I tried it on my brother's system over the holidays, and
         it worked just like 7.  
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Note that Solaris 2.5 doesn't have support for snprintf().  The code
     has been tweaked to switch to sprintf() for these calls in this case,
     which allows more places for buffer overflow problems (this is a
     security issue as well as a stability issue).  Solaris 2.6 and later
     has support for snprintf().

     Solaris 7.0 has Xpm support built into Motif, so you'll be able to
     use Xpm map files within Xastir.

     You need BSD-make installed on your system in order to compile Xastir.
     Type "gmake" instead of "make" to build Xastir, and substitute "gmake"
     for "make" in the following instructions.

     ---
     From: Chris Bell

     A note to add, the auto* tools from sunfreeware (precompiled packages)
     need the environment variable M4 set to gnu m4 (M4=/usr/local/bin/m4)
     to work.  I also set LDFLAGS to '-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib' (to
     avoid the ancient libtiff in /usr/openwin/lib) before running configure,
     then the tests (and final link) work properly.

     Solaris 9/AEA PK232MBX notes from Alan Shackelford:

     Thanks to the advice of several of you both on the list and in private 
     email, the NG3B Xastir install is up and running. For future reference, 
     here are the steps I took, based on your advice combined with my 
     knowledge of Solaris and the AEA PK232MBX.

     First, use admintool to set up the serial port at 8N1 9600.

     Have a look at the /etc/uucp/Devices file and ensure you have the 
     following in there someplace (like at the very bottom):

        ACU cua/b - Any hayes
        Direct cua/b - Any direct


     Then use 'cu' (solaris-ese for call unix) to send a '*' to the TNC.
     You will receive a response from the TNC with copyright info, etc.

     Close the 'cu' session and start Xastir from a terminal window.

     Set the Interface to 9600 8N1 in the configuration screen. Start the 
     interface using the Interface Start/Stop window. The data will begin to
     flow.

        MANDRAKE LINUX NOTES:

      With Mandrake Linux 8.x? you may get linker errors when it tries to
      link in the "Xp" library.  To fix this, edit xastir/src/Makefile,
      adding "-lXp" to the LIBS line, then type "make" again.

        END OF MANDRAKE LINUX NOTES.

        OpenSuSE LINUX 10.0 NOTES:

        Bring up YaST2 and add more download sites via:

            Software->Installation Source

        Two sites that I use are:

        ftp://suse.mirrors.tds.net/pub/opensuse/distribution/SL-10.0-OSS/inst-source/suse
        ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/ham/10.0-i386

        Adding these sites will allow you to find and install the ax25
        libraries/devel headers and the OpenMotif development headers.

        You'll see this warning if you run ./bootstrap.sh:

            4... Running aclocal
            /usr/share/aclocal/pstoedit.m4:7: warning: underquoted definition of
            AM_PATH_PSTOEDIT
              run info '(automake)Extending aclocal'
              or see
            http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html#Extending-aclocal

        You may safely ignore this warning.

        You'll may also see these when compiling the code:

        map_tif.c: In function `my_GTIFProj4FromLatLong':
        map_tif.c:391: warning: implicit declaration of function `CSLTokenizeStringComplex'
        map_tif.c:391: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
        map_tif.c:394: warning: implicit declaration of function `CSLCount'
        map_tif.c:396: warning: implicit declaration of function `CSLDestroy'
        x_spider.c: In function `UDP_Server':
        x_spider.c:1203: warning: pointer targets in passing argument 6 of `recvfrom' differ in signedness

        You may safely ignore them as well.

        Optional but highly recommended:  Install the colorgcc package, then go
        into /usr/share/doc/packages/colorgcc and "cp colorgccrc ~/.colorgccrc"
        This will cause any GCC warnings or errors to show up in a different
        color in your Xterm window.  VERY handy.

        Plese note that the AX.25 kernel support in SuSE 10.0 doesn't work.
        There are patches being discussed on the linux-hams list, but these
        patches are not currently part of SuSE.  Use the Serial KISS TNC
        interface in Xastir instead if you're using a KISS TNC with this
        version of SuSE.

        gcc_3.4.2_hppa-hp-hpux11.11_depot

      HPUX 11.11 doesn't seem to have seteuid and setegid calls so:

      - Installed and linked against HP's Linux libraries:

      http://devrsrc1.external.hp.com/LPK/

      - Changed a couple #include <strings.h>  to:

        #ifdef HAVE_STRING_H
        #  include <string.h>
        #else
        #  include <strings.h>
        #endif

      - added  #include <sys/modem.h> to interface.h


      Current status:  It runs, but it seg-faults when connected to an APRS(tm)
      IS server.

        END OF HP/UX NOTES.

     (7) GATING WEATHER ALERTS, STATIONS, OBJECTS/ITEMS TO RF

      Gating NWS Weather Alerts to RF:
      --------------------------------
      If you wish to gate NWS weather alerts from the Internet onto RF, you'll
      need to create a text file in the users directory as 
      ~/.xastir/data/nws-stations.txt
      List each NWS station that you would like to transmit via RF. Wildcards
      are implied for lengths of 3 or greater. Here's what an example file
      looks like:

      ------------- Cut Here -------------
      #
      # Seattle, WA
      SEANPW
      #
      # Portland, OR (any alert type)
      PDX
      #
      # Pendleton, OR
      PDTNPW
      #
      # Medford, OR
      MFRNPW
      #
      ------------- Cut Here -------------

      All text should start at the beginning of the line.

      Once that file is in place, you'll need to hook up to at least one
      Internet server that is feeding you the weather alerts. You'll also need
      to have at least one RF interface up and running with transmit enabled on
      that interface. Make sure that "Interfaces->Disable Transmit: All" is not
      selected.  You should now be gating NWS weather messages to RF.

      Turn on igate logging and look at that log file to view what you're
      sending out via RF. Don't forget to turn off logging or set up
      auto-rollover of the log files, else your hard drive might fill up with
      logging info. Auto-rollover of log files is typically accomplished via
      CRON.

      Gating Stations, Objects/Items to RF:
      -------------------------------------
      The latest code also allows gating packets from specific stations to RF
      using the above method (except object/item packets).  You can also gate
      objects/items to RF by name.  The same wildcarding rules apply as listed
      above.  Callsigns or object/item names listed in this file are
      case-insensitive, so they'll match any case in received packets.

      Bob Bruninga, WB4APR, recommends gating these calls to RF:
        
        SCOUTS, SATERN, KIDS, REDCROSS, FOUR-H, YOUTH, GUARD, MARS, JOTA

      See his link: "Generic Callsigns for National Events" off this web page
      for his current list of recommended callsigns:

     (9) MAILING LIST

          There are currently a couple of mailing lists about Xastir.
          xastir@xastir.org is the one relevant for posts about
          Xastir 0.4.0 and up (and bug fixes, and suggestions, etc).

          To subscribe to the Xastir mailing list, send email to:
          xastir-request@xastir.org In the body of the message,
          put "subscribe xastir"; or go to
          http://www.xastir.org and click on "User List" or
          "Developer List" links on the left to subscribe.

               ### DO NOT SEND FRANK EMAIL ABOUT XASTIR ###

          Frank is no longer developing the Xastir code (although
          he does put a word in every now and then) so don't bother
          e-mailing him. If you have a serious problem, email the
          Xastir mailing list and it will get to the coders.

          Please, before posting to this list, see what things are
          like, and when you do post, read over your post for
          readability, spelling, and grammar mistakes. Obviously,
          we're all human (or are we?) and we all make mistakes (heck,
          look at this document! ;).

          Open discussion and debate is integral to change and
          progress. Don't flame others over mere form (grammar and
          spelling), or even substantive issues either for that
          matter. Please read and follow the mailing list rules.

          The xastir@xastir.org mail-list is dedicated to Bug
          reports, technical questions, your thoughts or
          suggestions on new features being added to Xastir, things
          that should be removed or fixed, amazing problems that even
          stump the guru's, etc... are what we want to see here.

     (10) DOCUMENTATION

          We're trying to keep the documentation up to date. If you
          feel that anything is missing here, or that anything should
          be added etc, please email xastir@xastir.org about it,
          thank you.

     (11) OBTAINING HELP

          Please read the file FAQ, and make sure you've followed any relevant
          instructions in INSTALL. If the problem still exists, feel free to
          ask on the Xastir mailing-list, as described above.
