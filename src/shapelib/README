Building on Unix
----------------

1) Edit Makefile, and set CFLAGS, and CC macros as required for the
   target system.  Often the defaults will work fine.

2) "type make" 

The result should be:

Core shapelib support.  
  shpopen.o
  dbfopen.o

Utility/demonstration programs:
  shpcreate, shpdump, shpadd, dbfcreate, dbfdump, dbfadd

To test type:
  make test


Building on Windows
-------------------

If you have run the VC++ VCVARS32.BAT, you should be able to type the 
following in a command window to build the code and executables:

C:>  nmake /f makefile.vc 

Otherwise create your own VC++ project.  There aren't many files to deal with
here!
