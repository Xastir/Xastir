General steps to configure/compile/install Xastir:
(See detailed steps and library installation instructions below)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Get one of the source releases from Github at
      https://github.com/Xastir/Xastir/releases
   and explode it.  (Replace X.Y.Z with the release number below)

  mkdir Xastir
  cp Xastir-Release-X.Y.Z.tar.gz Xastir
  cd Xastir
  tar xzvf Xastir-Release-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

An alternative to the above steps is to use git to download the
Xastir sources.  See README.GIT for those instructions. Git allows
you to easily keep up to date with the developers.

2) Go into the xastir directory to build the executable:

  cd Xastir

  The first time you do this you need to create the "configure"
  script.  To do this run:

  ./bootstrap.sh

  Note that bootstrap requires that you have GNU Autoconf and Automake
  installed on your system.  Any error messages from bootstrap mean
  that something is missing and you will be unable to proceed, so fix
  those problems first.

Then create a build directory, configure and build the code:

  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  ../configure
  make
  su (become the root user)
  make install (make install-strip can be used after the first time)
  chmod 4555 /usr/local/bin/xastir (only if you use kernel ax.25, see below)
  exit (from root)

3) Xastir should be installed in /usr/local/bin (the default on most
systems).  You can run it by typing this from a shell:

    xastir &

Installing only the required libs gives you these capabilities:

    PocketAPRS maps
    aprsDOS maps
    WinAPRS maps
    MacAPRS maps
    GNIS labels
    Address searching
    serial port and Internet gateway connectivity.

Adding XPM or ImageMagick libs, ImageMagick's "convert" utility, and
the "gv" utility gives you printing capability.  Postscript or
emulated postscript printing capability is required for this as well.

Adding XPM or ImageMagick libs plus "convert" also give the
capability to create automatic PNG images on disk from the map
screen (useful for web pages!).

Adding Shapelib support also gives you the capability to use Tiger
2000 maps which were converted to Shapefile format by ESRI.  This
allows you to use free detailed street maps for any point in the
U.S.

Adding other libraries gives you the additional capabilities listed
above.

For those who would like to see the full list of libraries Xastir
might use (to decide what packages to install), here's the ldd
command run against a pretty much fully-loaded Xastir.  Note that
quite a few of these libraries are pulled in by the ImageMagick
library, and your library list may look little like it due to
differences in how ImageMagick was compiled:

Things you need for this version:
---------------------------------
 * Get Lesstif/OpenMotif from your favorite Linux/Unix distribution.
-or-
 * Lesstif: www.lesstif.org (look below for RED-HAT instructions)
-or-
 * OpenMotif: www.openmotif.org

 * AX25 packages: (if you want support for kernel AX25 interfaces)
    Lib AX25
    AX25 apps
    AX25 tools
    The apps package is not required, but strongly suggested.

     These packages are in most Linux distributions but may be out
     of date.  See the linux-hams mailing list for details.

 * You should have glibc on your system that supports threads!


For geoTIFF support (such as USGS DRG topo maps) you also need:

    libtiff (should be in the package set of most distributions):
    ------------------------------------------------
        http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/

    libproj (proj-4.4.9 or later):
    ---------------------
        http://proj4.org/

    Datum translations (proj-nad27 or proj-datumgrid):
    --------------------------------------------------
        http://proj4.org/

    libgeotiff (any version later than libgeotiff-1.1.5):
    --------------------------------------------------
        http://geotiff.osgeo.org/

    Please note that the order of installation for the above libraries is
    critical.  Follow the instructions below carefully.  Also, the particular
    libgeotiff you use depends on the version of libtiff you have installed.

For Linux kernel AX.25 interfaces, you require these packages:
    Lib AX25
    AX25 apps
    AX25 tools

    These packages are in most Linux distros.  Source code and other
    information about them can be found at:
        http://www.linux-ax25.org/wiki/Main_Page
    The apps package is not required, but strongly suggested.

    See the AX.25 HOWTO and the linux-hams mailing list for
     details.

For speech support via the festival speech synthesis software you need:
    festival.  Many package management systems have it already
    but source and documentation are at:

       http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/


 

For ESRI Shapefile format maps/weather alert maps:
    Shapelib:
        http://shapelib.maptools.org/
    pcre:
        http://www.pcre.org

For ImageMagick support for maps in any of 68 major graphics formats,
   including the capability to use online maps and weather radar images:
    ImageMagick:
        http://www.imagemagick.org/

To use online maps or findu.com historical data, you'll need wget or
   libcurl/libcurl-devel installed.  Many systems have these pre-installed,
   so check first.  You may need to upgrade your installed version for
   this feature to work correctly from within Xastir:
    Wget:
        ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/
    libcurl:
        http://curl.sourceforge.net/


To download GPS tracks/waypoints/routes from a Garmin GPS into Xastir,
converting to Shapefile format maps as it runs, you'll need gpsmanshp and
GPSMan.  GPSMan 6.0 and later has command-line support built-in so that
Xastir can control it directly, but only GPSMan 6.1 and later are currently
usable with Xastir:
    gpsmanshp:
        http://www.ncc.up.pt/gpsmanshp/
    GPSMan:
        http://www.ncc.up.pt/gpsman/
        http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/science/cartography

See below for instructions on installing all of these libraries. Once the 
  libraries are installed, ./configure should find the libraries and allow
  compiling in support for the new features.


If you wish to enable/disable configure's testing of certain
features, you can add any of the following flags to configure:

    --without-ax25
    --without-festival
    --without-gpsman
    --without-imagemagick
    --without-libproj
    --without-geotiff
    --without-shapelib
    --without-pcre
    --without-dbfawk
    --without-map-cache
    --with-errorpopups
    --with-libgc
    --with-profiling
    --with-rtree
    --with-lsb
    --with-postgis
    --with-mysql

For example, "./configure --without-ax25" will disable the AX.25
networking code in Xastir.

If you have installed Xastir before, read the "UPGRADE" file for
information on changes in file location and permissions.


First Time Install:
-------------------

   1. OPTIONAL:  If you wish to use AX.25 interfaces, install the AX.25
      packages.  Verify that they are configured and working. Use "listen"
      to watch the packets fly by after getting AX.25 configured and hooked
      to a TNC.  Use the AX.25 HOWTO document to guide you in this process.


   2. Install LessTif or OpenMotif

     If you already have Motif or OpenMotif on your system, including
     the development headers, then you won't need to install LessTif. Most
     distributions include one of these; step 2a describes building from
     source, while 2b describes installing from pre-built packages on
     your distribution. Now that OpenMotif is available, you may be happier
     running it than LessTif, but either one should work with Xastir.

     Some users have had problems with OpenMotif, and others have had troubles
     with LessTif. Symptoms are often menu problems (menus don't draw
     correctly, menus won't respond to clicks). If you encounter these
     problems, then uninstall the current Motif and install the other.  Several
     Mac users have reported problems with OpenMotif, so LessTif may be a
     better place to start.

        2a. Download LessTif version 0.91.1 or higher or download OpenMotif.
        Follow the instructions provided, compile it and install it.

        Usually,
         ./configure
         make
         su (root)
         make install
         /sbin/ldconfig
         exit (from root)

        Or you can try any other OSF/Motif(R) version 1.2


       2b. Install LessTif or OpenMotif (from a package)

       Download the lestif-devel (if it exists) and lestif, and install it
       as your distribution instructs you to install packages.


   3. OPTIONAL:  Install geoTIFF support.  Allows using USGS DRG topo maps or
     other types of geoTIFF maps/images and has the ability to tile smaller
     maps into a larger contiguous map of an area:


       3a.  Check/Edit your startup files:
       -----------------------------
       Check that /usr/local/lib, /usr/lib, and /usr/X11R6/lib are
       all listed in /etc/ld.so.conf, and run /sbin/ldconfig to
       re-create the system's cache file. If you don't have
       permission to edit this file:
            Edit ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, .cshrc, or
            .login and add:

            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/X11R6/lib

       This will let the loader find the shared libraries when it tries to
       load Xastir into memory.

       If you instead have a /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory, then this will add
       the /usr/local/lib directory to the search:  Create a file in the
       /etc/ld.so.conf.d called "local.conf".  The file should contain exactly
       one line:

            /usr/local/lib

       Use your favorite text editor or use these commands:

           echo "/usr/local/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
           ldconfig -v

       Check that you aren't already defining LD_LIBRARY_PATH somewhere else.
       If so, just add the paths above to it.  Make sure this environment
       variable is defined in the current shell you're using to compile Xastir.
       Note that if you're running Xastir SUID root, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       variable is ignored.


       3b. Install libproj:
       --------------------
     NOTE: You must install libproj BEFORE compiling libgeotiff, because
       libgeotiff uses libproj to do the datum translations. If you install
       libgeotiff first, datum translations won't work.

       proj-nad27-1.1.tar.gz or proj-datumgrid-1.3.zip must be decompressed in
       the nad subdirectory of the proj distribution directory before you run
       configure.
        
        tar xzvf proj-4.4.9.tar.gz (or newer)
        cd proj-4.4.9/nad
        unzip ../../proj-datumgrid-1.3.zip (or tar xzvf ../../proj-nad27-1.1.tar.gz)
        cd ..
        ./configure
        make
        su (root)
        make install
        /sbin/ldconfig
        exit (from root)

        libproj should now be installed in:

            /usr/local/include/
            /usr/local/lib/
            /usr/local/bin/
            /usr/local/share/proj/

       You may need to do this (as root) if the "make install" portion fails
       because it can't find "ginstall":

       cd /usr/bin
       ln -s install ginstall

       Then retry the "make install" portion above.


       3c. Upgrade libtiff if needed:
       -----------------------------
       The best way to install libtiff is to get it from the ftp site
       for your Linux distribution.  You must have libtiff 3.5.5 or
       newer for libgeotiff 1.1.x to compile and run correctly, or libtiff
       3.6.0 BETA or newer for libgeotiff 1.2.x to work correctly.

       If you're using libtiff 3.6.0 BETA or newer, things are simplified.
       Just use libgeotiff 1.2.x or newer and they should play nicely together.

       ---------
       Notes for older libtiff (less than 3.6.0 BETA):

           If you are compiling libtiff from source, you must use
           "make install_private" because the libtiff private include files
           are required for libgeotiff to compile and work correctly.

           You may also snag just the include files listed below from the
           source distribution or the source RPM, and copy them manually to
           their destinations.

           The errors you'll get if you don't match up the older libtiff and
           libgeotiff by way of the include files:  Xastir will seg-fault when
           it tries to read a geotiff file.
       ---------

       If you upgrade libtiff, check that programs like XV, ImageMagick, and
       the Gimp still run (if you have these programs installed).  Graphics
       programs that read/write TIFF format depend on libtiff.


       3d. Install libgeotiff:
       -----------------------

     NOTE: Depending on your version of libtiff, either libgeotiff-1.1.5 or
       libgeotiff-1.2.4 may compile properly.  libgeotiff is intimately
       tied to your version of libtiff.  libgeotiff 1.2.x or greater
       requires libtiff-3.6.0 BETA or later.  If your version of libtiff is
       older, get libgeotiff 1.1.4 or 1.1.5.  For the latter case you may
       also have to download the sources for your version of libtiff in
       order to copy one libtiff header file into the libgeotiff source
       directory.

     -----------------------
     Pre 3.6.0 libtiff NOTE: You may need to snag some files from your exact
       libtiff source distribution and place them into your /usr/include
       directory before libgeotiff will compile.  Note:  I said use files from
       the EXACT same distribution of libtiff that you already have installed!

            libtiff/tiffconf.h
            libtiff/tiffiop.h
            libtiff/tif_dir.h
            contrib/dosdjgpp/port.h

       Drop all four files into the /usr/include/ directory, creating no 
       subdirectories at all.  This allows the libgeotiff code to "see"
       into the libtiff library so that it can use some functions that
       aren't normally (publicly) available.  Try to make sure that
       you're not overwriting any files in /usr/include/ by the same name.
       Some of these files may already be present in /usr/local/.  If so,
       they should be exact duplicates.  "diff filename1 filename2" will
       tell you if there are any differences between two files.

       If you'd rather not mess with the /usr/include directory,
       you can drop the four files into the
       libgeotiff-1.1.5/libtiff_private/ directory instead.  Libgeotiff
       will pick up the files there, issue a warning to you that you're
       using private include files, yet still compile in support for your
       particular version of libtiff.

       With libgeotiff-1.2.4/libtiff-3.6.0-beta or newer you shouldn't
       need to copy these files across.  The newer libtiff and libgeotiff
       can work together using public interfaces.
     ------------------------

        tar xzvf libgeotiff-1.2.4.tar.gz (or newer)
        cd libgeotiff-1.2.4
        ./configure
        make
        su (root)
        make install
        /sbin/ldconfig (tells the loader about the new libraries)
        exit (from root)
       libgeotiff should now be installed in:

            /usr/local/include/
            /usr/local/lib/
            /usr/local/share/epsg_csv/
            /usr/local/bin/

       If you must re-run "configure" for any of these libraries, remember to 
       delete "config.status" and "config.cache" files first.


   4. RECOMMENDED:  Install ESRI Shapefile support.  Allows using many sources
     of online polygon, polyline, and point maps, including ones from NOAA.
     This is also the format for weather alert maps.  This support is provided
     by the shapelib package.

     NOTE:  There are TWO ways to install Shapelib, using the version of
     Shapelib that comes with Xastir (statically linked with Xastir), or using
     a separate Shapelib shared library (dynamically linked with Xastir).  If
     you ONLY require Shapelib for Xastir and won't need it for any other
     program, then you may use the private copy distributed with Xastir,
     skipping the Shapelib install instructions in this section.  If you have
     other programs which need Shapelib, then it is recommended that you
     install Shapelib first as a shared library, per the instructions below.
     If you skip the instructions in this sections, "./configure" will set the
     compile up so that the private Shapelib code will be statically
     linked to the executable.

     It isn't clear from the install instructions in shapelib, but just 
     installing the library is sufficient, and just typing "make" and 
     "make install" doesn't make or install the libraries.  Take these steps:

       make lib
       su (root)
       make lib_install
       /sbin/ldconfig
       exit (from root)

     and you should have what you need.
 
     You may also need to tweak "/etc/ld.so.conf" to contain the proper path
     to the libraries and then run /sbin/ldconfig to update "/etc/ld.so.cache".
     Once this is done the loader should be able to find the Shapelib library.
     Must run /sbin/ldconfig as root for the system to be able to re-create its
     cache file.  See the instructions earlier in this file if you have an
     /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory instead (section 3A).

     For MacOSX:  Bill Owen, N2RKL, suggested the following for
     ShapeLib:

       "The shapelib Makefile wouldn't work out of the box, so I
       figured out what the important bits were and built them by
       hand:"

       -----------------------------------------------
         cc -c shpopen.c
         cc -c shptree.c
         cc -c dbfopen.c
         ar cru libshp.a shpopen.o shptree.o dbfopen.o
         sudo cp libshp.a /sw/lib
         sudo ranlib /sw/lib/libshp.a
         sudo mkdir /sw/include/libshp
         sudo cp shapefil.h /sw/include/libshp/
       -----------------------------------------------

    Note that you'll have to set up /etc/sudoers file to allow those
    commands to be run by a normal user before sudo will work for
    you.  See the README.Git file for sudo instructions.



    COMPILING OPTIONAL UTILITIES FOR SHAPELIB:

    These utilities are sometimes useful when writing dbfawk rules
    but aren't necessary for running Xastir.

      cd xastir/src/shapelib
      make -f Makefile_shapelib_orig

      cd contrib
      make -f Makefile_orig

     You'll be left with useful executables in the xastir/src/shapelib and
     xastir/src/shapelib/contrib directories.  It's your choice whether to
     copy them to a directory in your path (perhaps /usr/local/bin?) to make
     them easier to use.


   5. OPTIONAL:  Install -either- GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick support as
     shown below.  Xastir will use one or the other but not both.  It'll prefer
     GraphicsMagick over ImageMagick if both are installed.  Do step 5a -or- 5b
     below to get this type of image support compiled into Xastir.

     Allows using more than 68 different graphics format files as maps, by
     creating an associated .geo file for each with tie-points.  This support
     will allow use of online Tiger and Terraserver maps with Xastir, and NOAA
     weather radar images.  Other people are working on integrating even more
     online mapping sources.  This will also allow you to use any GIF/JPG/XPM/
     BMP/... image as an Xastir map. Installation instructions are included in
     the package. If you choose to install from a binary install, be sure that
     you have all the graphic format libraries that it was originally built
     with.

     The easiest way to install one of these is via a package from your linux
     distribution's CD or ftp site. If you install from such a package, make
     sure the header files are installed. These are often in a separate package
     called GraphicsMagick-devel or ImageMagick-devel or similar.

 
   5a. OPTIONAL:  Install GraphicsMagick support.

     Download the GraphicsMagick sources from:

     http://www.graphicsmagick.org

     Uncompress/un-tar them...

        tar -xzvf Gr*

     Change directory to the newly created GraphicsMagick directory and
     compile:

        cd Gr*
        ./configure --with-quantum-depth=16 --enable-shared
        make
        su -c 'make install'
        su -c '/sbin/ldconfig'

     Skip the next step (5b) as you only need ImageMagick support installed if
     you _don't_ install GraphicsMagick.
 
 
   5b. OPTIONAL:  Install ImageMagick graphics support.

     Note that Xastir's "./configure" stage may fail trying to compile in
     ImageMagick support.  If this happens, make sure you have the ImageMagick
     development package installed if using RPM packages, or have installed
     the ImageMagick header files.  If it still fails, check the "config.log"
     file _very_ carefully.  Often ImageMagick tests fail due to some other
     library that ImageMagick depends upon being absent, such as liblcms,
     libbz2, or others.  This can also cause AX.25 support to be dropped in our
     current "configure" script.  We're working on that.

     Until the RPM packagers for ImageMagick include all of the dependent
     libraries in their RPM dependency list, the best way to assure that
     ImageMagick is installed properly is to install it from sources.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Note: Red Hat 9.0's install of ImageMagick does not work with
     XASTIR.  It will need to be removed and installed from sources.
     If w3m text based web browser is installed, you will need to remove
     it before removing ImageMagick:

        rpm -e w3m
        rpm -e ImageMagick

     Download the Imagemagick sources from:

	ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/

     At the time of writing, this was

	ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/ImageMagick-5.5.7-34.tar.gz

     But you may need to get a newer version by the time you read this.

     Uncompress/un-tar them...

        tar -xzvf im*

     Change directory to the newly created ImageMagick directory and
     compile:

        cd im*
        ./configure
        make
        su -c 'make install'
        su -c '/sbin/ldconfig'

     These instructions are courtesy of Wes Johnston.
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------


   6. OPTIONAL:  If your system doesn't have wget or libcurl/libcurl-devel
     installed, and you want to use online maps, install either or both of
     those packages now. Installation instructions are included in the
     package.  Some older versions of wget don't work properly with
     Xastir, so even if you already have wget you may need to upgrade it.

     Please refer to the wget man pages or the web pages at
     http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html for info concerning wget.

     Note that if the remote server is down, Xastir can appear to hang
     for a bit before wget times out.  Xastir calls wget with no retries
     and a 30-second timeout, but one user reported that wget takes one
     minute fifteen seconds to time out.  Also note that the users ~/.wgetrc
     and the system-wide wgetrc file can change the timeouts and retries as
     well.  See the man pages for details.  Pay particular attention to
     which file/command-line-options take priority over others.  It looks
     like the command-line option "--execute command" will allow overriding
     the .wgetrc files, which means the user can override the hard-coded
     timeouts/retries in Xastir by specifying new defaults in their ~/.wgetrc
     file.

     Libcurl should be a drop-in replacement for the wget functionality that
     we use, and it's a faster and more secure method.

   7. OPTIONAL:  Installing gpsmanshp/GPSMan allows Xastir to fetch GPS
     waypoints/routes/tracks from a GPS.  Xastir can fetch the data
     automatically, create a Shapefile map, then index/select/display the
     new map.

     Make sure you have Shapelib installed first (see above instructions).

     Note that you may have to change the gpsmanshp Makefile to call out
     "TCLVERSION = 8.4" instead of 8.3, depending upon which version of tcl is
     installed on your system.  Use your package manager to determine this
     ("rpm -q -a | grep tcl"), or you may be able to find out in /usr/lib by
     typing "ls -ld tcl*".

     Install gpsmanshp:

     tar xzvf gpsmanshp_1.2.2.tgz
     cd gpsmanshp
     make
     su -c 'make install'

     Install GPSMan:

     tar xzvf gpsman-6.0.tgz
     cd gpsman-6.0
     vi gpsman.tcl
       Change SRCDIR line to: "set SRCDIR /usr/lib/gpsman"
     su (root)
     mkdir /usr/lib/gpsman
     cp gpsman.tcl /usr/lib/gpsman
     ln -s /usr/lib/gpsman/gpsman.tcl /usr/X11R6/bin/gpsman
     cd gmsrc
     cp * /usr/lib/gpsman
     cp -R gmicons /usr/lib/gpsman
     chmod -R 755 /usr/lib/gpsman
     chmod 644 /usr/lib/gpsman/gmicons
     chmod 777 /usr/local/share/xastir/maps/GPS   (IMPORTANT!)
     exit (from root)

     Verify that GPSMan will start up and will download information from a
     Garmin GPS in Garmin-Garmin mode.  This also creates the configuration
     files needed to use GPSMan with Garmin GPS's from within Xastir (sets
     GPS type, serial port, etc within GPSMan's configs).

   8. OPTIONAL: Install Festival for speech support
      To use speech you must have a sound card and the 'festival' speech
      synthesis software installed. Install Festival and start it in 'server'
      mode prior to starting up XASTIR.  The normal command for this is
      "festival --server &". More info about the speech features is in the
      Xastir help file. An easy way to get festival installed on some systems
      is to go to rpmfind.com and search for both festival and festival-dev,
      then install the RPM's found. Red Hat RPM's installed onto SuSE 7.3 with
      no problems. Note that the default voice doesn't speak numbers very well.
      Edit /usr/share/festival/voices.scm and put "ked_diphone" at the first of
      the "defvar default-voice-priority-list". This will change the default
      voice to "ked_diphone".

      Note that you can start up the festival server and test it out manually
      by typing these commands:

        telnet localhost 1314
        (SayText "Hello")

      To exit, press control-] and then type "quit".

   9. OPTIONAL:  Install Berkely DB Library to enable map caching
      of internet maps.

      Please note that segfaults (crashes) in Berkeley DB calls can be caused
      by having multiple versions of the library installed.  The programming
      interface has changed between the versions.  If you compile Xastir with
      one version's header files but Xastir links to another version's
      library, you can easily end up with segfaults when Xastir runs.  SuSE
      Linux for instance has these available which you _should_ install:

            db 
            db-devel

      Plus SuSE has these additional packages available which you should _not_
      install.  Remove them if they're on your system (using YaST or rpm):

            db-40
            db42

      Xastir will normally try to use /usr/include/db.h as the header file,
      and /usr/lib/libdb.so as the library it will link to (which is usually
      a symlink to something else, like /usr/lib/libdb-4.1.so).  If the
      header file and the library file don't match, a segfault often occurs.
      The easiest way to avoid problems is to keep one and only one version
      of the Berkeley DB library on your system.

      Here's how to test what version of include file and library file you're
      using:  Find the db.h file.  It's usually in /usr/include/db.h.

            grep DB_VERSION db.h

      Mine shows this:

        #define DB_VERSION_MAJOR        4
        #define DB_VERSION_MINOR        1
        #define DB_VERSION_PATCH        25
        #define DB_VERSION_STRING       "Sleepycat Software: Berkeley DB 4.1.25: (October  2, 2003)"

      Now do this:

        ldd /usr/local/bin/xastir | grep libdb

      Mine shows this:

        libdb-4.1.so => /usr/lib/libdb-4.1.so (0x40680000)

      In this case, version 4.1 of the include file matches 4.1 of the library
      file, so it works fine.  A mismatch in the first two numbers can cause
      segfaults when Xastir tries to do map caching.

      If you install the Berkeley DB library in an unusual place (something
      other than /usr/lib and /usr/include), you should still be able to tell
      configure where to find it.  This comes courtesy of Tom Russo:

      > > Someone installed Berkeley DB Library here:
      > > 
      > >     /user/local/BerkeleyDB.4.3/include/db.h
      > > 
      > > Perhaps I can assume that the library would be located here:
      > > 
      > >     /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.3/lib/libdb.so
      > > 
      > > How does one go about specifying the location of the db.h file and
      > > the libdb.so file so that configure/compile/loading of Xastir work

      > --with-bdb-libdir=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.3/lib
      > and
      > --with-bdb-incdir=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB4.3/include

   10. OPTIONAL:  Compile db2APRS and install MySQL and Meteo to
      allow Davis weather station support.

      Install MySQL and Meteo. 

        "cd Davis"
        "./bootstrap.sh"
        "./configure"
        "make"

      This should build db2APRS in the "src" directory.  Start up db2APRS.
      Xastir should be able to connect to the db2APRS server in order to get
      the Davis weather station data.  See further instructions in the Davis
      directory.

   11. OPTIONAL: Experimental.  Add GIS database support.  

      Note: Database support is experimental and any aspect may change at
      any time, including database structures.  Scripts to create database
      tables for MySQL and Postgres/Postgis are in the scripts directory
      as db_gis_postgis.sql and db_gis_mysql.sql.

      Warning: If you are connected to internet feeds for APRS data, it
      is possible to accumulate several million station records per day
      which could amount to around 300 MB of database records per day.  

      Postgres + Postgis:
      Install Postgres.  Include development packages (libpq).
      Add Postgis spatial object support to Postgres.

      Compile xastir with --with-postgis

      After building xastir:
      Create a database named xastir and a user with create rights on 
      that database.
      Edit db_gis_postgis.sql to set username and password for an xastir
      user with select access to the xastir database.
      Default values are database=xastir, user=xastir_user
      You may also need to set permissions in pg_hba.conf.
      Run the queries in db_gis_postgis.sql.
      Run xastir and add a SQL Database interface, start with the postgis
      defaults, add the username and password of the xastir user. 

      Other GIS applications (e.g. QGIS, Mapserver, GRASS) can access and
      display station data directly from the postgresql/postgis database.  

      You can configure the database interface to read station from the 
      database on startup and to save stations as they are heard to the
      database.  This provides persistance of station data between
      xastir sessions.

      MySQL:
      Install MySQL.  Include development packages (libmysqlclient).

      Compile xastir with --with-mysql

      After building xastir:
      Create a database named xastir and a user with create rights on 
      that database.
      Edit db_gis_mysql.sql to set username and password for an xastir
      user with select access to the xastir database.
      Default values are database=xastir, user=xastir_user
      Run the queries in db_gis_mysql.sql
         mysql xastir -p < db_gis_mysql.sql
      Run xastir and add a SQL Database interface, start with the MySQL
      defaults, add the username and password of the xastir user. 

      You can configure the database interface to read station from the 
      database on startup and to save stations as they are heard to the
      database.  This provides persistance of station data between
      xastir sessions.

      If you have one or more spatial database interfaces set to activate on 
      startup, and this produces a situation that won't let you start xastir
      normally [e.g. Station data with unusual characters could concevable 
      cause xastir to segfault when retrieved from the database, and 
      interactions between multiple databases that are both writing are 
      reading station data at the same time from each other could potentally 
      be unstable], you should be able to start xastir by editing the 
      device configuration in ~/.xastir/config/xastir.cnf
      Look for DEVICEn_TYPE:14 lines (where n is the interface number, between 0
      and 14, TYPE:14 devices are sql database interfaces), and edit the
      device to set both query on startup and on startup values to 0.
      DEVICEn_QUERY_ON_STARTUP:0
      DEVICEn_ONSTARTUP:0
      If the cause is problematic data in your database, you may need to
      run a delete query to eliminate the problematic row(s).  
     
 
   12. Building XASTIR:  Note that you'll need autoconf 2.53 or newer and
      automake 1.6.3 or newer in order to run the "./bootstrap.sh" script.
    
        "./bootstrap.sh" (This step needed only for those using Git)
        "mkdir -p build"
        "cd build"
        "../configure"
        "make" ("gmake" for Solaris or *BSD)

     This builds XASTIR, You should not get any error or warning messages.

     If you get the message from Xastir's configure script saying:

       "**** NO MOTIF HEADERS FOUND **** install Motif development headers or
         use --with-motif-includes to specify location of Xm/Xm.h" 

     even though you've got the Motif libraries and headers installed in the
     proper places, you might need to add this to the configure line:

        "--x-includes=/usr/X11R6/include"

     If that option does not help, then Motif is installed somewhere other 
     than with the standard X includes.  You must locate the file "Xm.h," 
     which should be in a subdirectory called "Xm" somewhere.  Once located
     (let's say in /usr/include/Motif/Xm/Xm.h), use the configure option:

       "--with-motif-includes=/usr/include/Motif"

     If you get the message:

       "**** MOTIF LIBRARIES NOT FOUND **** Install Motif development 
        headers/libraries or use --with-motif-libraries to specify path 
        to libXm.a"

     then your Motif libraries are not installed in the same directory as your
     other X libraries, and you must find the file libXm.a, libXm.so, 
     or libXm.sl.  Once found (say in /usr/lib/Motif, for example), tell 
     configure where to find it with:

        "--with-motif-libraries=/usr/lib/Motif"

     If you wish to install Xastir in a location other than the default
     ("/usr/local/bin" and "/usr/local/share/xastir" directories), you may
     add the "--prefix=<path>" flag to configure before compiling.  i.e.

     "./configure --prefix=/home/apps/xastir"

     Which will cause executables to be installed in "/home/apps/xastir/bin/"
     and the rest of Xastir to be installed under the
     "/home/apps/xastir/xastir/" directory.
 
     This is useful if you don't have root access on a machine, but still
     wish to install and use Xastir from your home directory.  There are
     probably many other uses as well.

     If you want to disable optional "dbfawk" support (see README.MAPS) then
     add "--without-dbfawk" to your "./configure", i.e.

     "./configure --without-dbfawk"

     Most people will want the capability though.

     You'll need the "pcre" package installed in order to compile in
     dbfawk support.

     To enable spatial indexing of shapefiles you can also add "--with-rtree" 
     to your configure command line.  Using spatial indices can speed up access
     of shapefiles that cover large areas if you're only viewing a smaller
     area, but at the cost of some additional RAM to store the spatial
     index.  This feature is still in the experimental phase, but some users
     have observed a noticeable speed-up in map redraws, especially
     with very large shapefiles.  The spatial indexing library used is based
     on public domain code obtained from Melinda Green,
     http://www.superliminal.com, but this code is included in xastir
     so you don't need to download anything to use it.

     If you see some errors, they might be because you are missing
     GNU msgfmt or GNU gettext/xgettext?  These packages are required
     to compile the latest Xastir sources.  Beware of packages with the
     same names installed into /usr/openwin/bin, these are probably NOT
     the GNU flavor of the executables and will not work for compiling
     Xastir.  For SuSE Linux:  Install "development/gettext" using YaST.

     If you do see some errors/warnings read the FAQ. If this doesn't help,
     or you think you have a different problem, dump the errors/warnings to
     a file, and send the file and the following information to the
     developers:

        System type (cpu), speed, memory,
        Linux Distribution,
        Linux Version,
        X Window manager (KDE, GNOME, FVWM, etc..)


     To install, type (as root)
        "make install" (or make install-strip to remove debugging information)

     If you later install additional libraries and just can't get
     ./configure to see them, remove the config.cache file via this
     command:  "rm config.cache", and then re-run configure.  Also
     see the notes above about /sbin/ldconfig.


   13. Kernel AX.25 Interfaces

     NOTE:  Xastir is designed by amateur radio operators, for amateur
     radio operators.  It is intended to be used only by them.  If there's
     a way for unlicensed users to operate the amateur radio equipment
     (this usually includes sending messages through it which key up the
     transmitter), it is a violation of the rules and your license (and
     more) may be at risk.  The same goes for igating:  Be aware of the
     rules for your country with respect to gating traffic from the 'net
     onto RF.  If there's any question, don't do it.

     Please read this entire section before typing anything, as there are
     serious security implications for some of this!

     Option 1)
     If you compiled support for AX.25 in and wish to use Kernel-mode
     AX-25 interfaces, you _may_ need to type this as root:

       chmod 4555 /usr/local/bin/xastir

     This command makes Xastir run as user "root", no matter who actually
     started it.  This allows Xastir to talk to the kernel AX.25 networking.
     Note however that the above chmod command will prevent you from creating
     a core file in case Xastir of a major program fault.  This core file aids
     in debugging to trace what went wrong.

     GENERAL SECURITY WARNING:
     Beware that Xastir has not been audited for security, and makes limited
     effort to drop extra privileges. Use this in a multi-user environment
     at your own risk!  The developers have worked hard to fix remote buffer
     overflows in the code to make Xastir safer to use, but there are _MANY_
     potential security risks remaining in the code.  User beware!  We will
     attempt to plug known security holes in future releases.

     Also be aware that turning on the Interface->Server ports (TCP and UDP)
     will allow other users who authenticate properly to send packets.  In
     the case of TCP they can only get routed to other TCP ports and to the
     internet.  UDP packets may also get routed to your RF ports (as
     third-party packets).

     LINUX-SPECIFIC SECURITY WARNING:  If you're using Linux AX.25 kernel
     networking, you'll need to either make Xastir SUID-root, or use a shim
     (which itself is set to SUID-root) between Xastir and the AX.25 ports.
     See Option #2 below for the (possibly safer) shim method.  If you're the
     paranoid type (and you should be if you're running a system with multiple
     users), you may wish to skip SUID-root mode/kernel AX.25 interfaces and
     use standard serial port TNC interfaces instead.  Any program is safer if
     run as a normal user (not safe, but safer).  It is currently impossible
     to use kernel-mode AX.25 interfaces without the program running with
     root privileges.

     Option 2)
     A more security-conscious option is to use a shim program written by
     Henk de Groot, PE1DNN.  This program runs in SUID-root mode but is
     much smaller and so is easier to audit for security, and provides a
     new port that Xastir can connect to.  The new port can be read/written
     without having to be the root user.  The program is called aprs_tty
     and can be obtained here:

     http://we7u.wetnet.net/xastir/aprs_tty.0.0.2.tgz

     It actually responds to some TNC commands. The code is straight forward
     and works well.  Run the program, telling it what port to use, and then
     in XASTIR set up the TNC to point to the new TTY at 19200. It
     transmits/receives UI frames, and sets the correct unproto path.  In
     this case DO NOT perform the chmod 4555 command on the Xastir executable.

     Note again that the same SUID-root warnings that were giving in option
     #1 above also apply to aprs_tty.  Buyer beware!  As far as we know,
     aprs_tty has not been audited for security, and makes no effort to drop
     extra privileges. Use this in a multi-user environment at your own risk!


   14. Serially-Connected TNC's

     NOTE:  Xastir is designed by amateur radio operators, for amateur
     radio operators.  It is intended to be used only by them.  If there's
     a way for unlicensed users to operate the amateur radio equipment
     (this usually includes sending messages through it which key up the
     transmitter), it is a violation of the rules and your license (and
     more) may be at risk.  The same goes for igating:  Be aware of the
     rules for your country with respect to gating traffic from the 'net
     onto RF.  If there's any question, don't do it.

     Please read this entire section before typing anything, as there are
     serious security implications for some of this!

     If you're using a serial TNC, configure your TNC startup files in the
     /usr/local/share/xastir/config directory:

     tnc-startup.sys is used to set up your TNC for Xastir and tnc-stop.sys
     is to change the TNC back to your normal settings. There are several
     example TNC startup files in the directory.  Choose the one that best
     suits your TNC and edit to taste.  See the note below about where to
     edit the files.  You might be unpleasantly surprised if after you type
     "make install" next, all your custom changes to the startup files are
     lost.  As always, keep a backup.

     Some people have had trouble getting Xastir to decode packets.  While
     packets were scrolling quite nicely in the View->Incoming Packet Data
     dialog, stations weren't showing up on the Xastir screen at all. The
     cause was incorrect settings in the tnc-startup files for that specific
     TNC. If you change these files in the xastir source directories make sure
     to do a "make install" to install them into the
     /usr/local/share/xastir/config/ directory. Another option would be to
     edit the files in /usr/local/share/xastir/config/ directly. Keep a copy
     of them in a safe place in any case.  You don't want to lose your custom
     mods you worked so hard to create.

     Some systems don't allow normal users to access the serial ports.  It's
     a permissions thing, but is actually the _correct_ way to configure the
     serial ports.  You can fix this in several ways:

     1) Add the Xastir user to the group owning the serial ports.
     2) Make Xastir run SGID-uucp (or whatever group owns the port).
     3) Change the permissions of the device so that any user can access it.
     4) Make Xastir run SUID-root.

     Solutions 3 and 4 are highly discouraged.  It can be a security nightmare
     to start opening up files or devices to read/write access by all users,
     and the same for SUID-root programs.  Don't do either of these.

     Exception:  If you're going to be running AX.25 kernel networking, you
     may need to be running Xastir SUID-root anyway, or else you need to
     install a shim program between the port and Xastir.  In the latter case
     the shim is running SUID-root, not Xastir.  See the section above
     regarding AX.25 kernel networking.

     Here are what the default permissions usually look like for the
     two serial ports on a Linux box:

     crw-rw----    1 root     uucp       4,  64 Oct 19 08:15 ttyS0
     crw-rw----    1 root     uucp       4,  65 Apr 14  2001 ttyS1

     (NOTE:  For a Windows/Cygwin installation, a few details are different,
     but the ttyS0 and ttyS1 keywords are the same.  Verify that the
     permissions of these ports are set appropriately for a normal user to read
     and write to these devices.)

     Solution #1:  The root user would run the commands necessary to add
     the Xastir user to the "uucp" group, which would then give the user
     the necessary permissions to use the port.  Usually this involves
     editing the /etc/group file, but SysAdmin tools usually exist for
     doing this more easily.

     Solution #2:  As root user, type these commands:

        chgrp uucp /usr/local/bin/xastir
        chmod 2555 /usr/local/bin/xastir

     If you want to restrict Xastir so that only one user can run it,
     (in this case "user1") type:

        chown user1 /usr/local/bin/xastir
        chmod 2500 /usr/local/bin/xastir
        chgrp uucp /usr/local/bin/xastir

     Solution #3:
     You can change the permissions of the serial port to allow use by all
     users, but this is highly discouraged.
     Here's what Jack Twilley had to say with regards to "chmod uog+rw" (same
     as chmod 555) for serial ports:

     > This is not necessary, and opens up the possibility of abuse.  Not all
     > Xastir installations are Linux boxes used by a single person with a
     > single purpose -- I know of several instances that are multi-user
     > machines with access to the Internet by multiple parties, some of whom
     > are not licensed amateurs, and another couple of instances where the
     > serial port is not always used by a TNC but also by other devices such
     > as Palm HotSync cradles and GPS receivers.
     > 
     > Here are two more secure solutions:
     > 
     >  * use non-root users
     >    One way to use the setuid facilities in Unix would be to set
     >    the xastir binary's user ID to match the user that owns the serial
     >    port.  Under Solaris, the default ownership of /dev/cua/a is
     >    uucp:tty, with a default permission of 0600.  The command 'chown
     >    uucp /usr/local/bin/xastir' followed by the command 'chmod 4555
     >    /usr/local/bin/xastir' will allow xastir to run properly without
     >    changing the serial port's permissions or ownership, thus
     >    minimizing any impact on other applications that use the serial
     >    port.

Note from Curt:  This chmod command will prevent creation of "core"
file that are useful for debugging in case Xastir crashes.

   15. Serially-Connected Garmin RINO Radio/GPS

     If you have a Garmin RINO attached to a serial port, have GPSMan
     installed, and have support for GPSMan compiled into Xastir, then Xastir
     has the capability to periodically download waypoints from the RINO unit
     and create APRS(tm) Objects out of them.  Any RINO waypoints that begin with
     "APRS" will be automatically created, placed on the map, and transmitted
     as your own Xastir APRS(tm) objects.  If you wish to see them but not transmit
     them, turn off Object/Item transmit or global transmit in the interface
     menu.  Another option is to turn off the transmit enable per interface.

     Please note that Xastir cannot cause the attached RINO to poll the other
     RINO units on the air.  Xastir can only download the waypoints that the
     attached RINO has collected from the other RINO units that it is passively
     monitoring.

     Here's a blurb from Wes Johnston about the RINO's:

     "Lets say I have three RINO radios... two in the hands of the SAR teams on
     the ground, and a third radio in a plane circling above.  It is preferred
     that the radio in the hands of the SAR teams be the nicer rino120 since it
     does mapping.  The radio in the plane can be the lowly rino110 since it
     does not do mapping but you will have a copy of xastir with maps on the
     laptop with you anyway.

     If I set two of my rino radios to APRSSAR1 and APRSSAR2, and connect a
     third rino radio to xastir with serial in the plane, xastir will query
     rino radio #3 at any one minute interval between 0 and 30 minutes, get the
     APRS* waypoints, lop off the first four characters and publish the shorter
     named waypoints as SAR1 and SAR2 as APRS(tm) objects on to your TNC.  The
     hitch to this is that the rino radio cannot automatically poll the RINO
     users' locations on the ground.  You have to manually (on the radio)
     select a menu item called POLL and poll the users that way.  The reason
     the first four characters of the rino callsign have to be "APRS" is that
     when you send a query, rino only asks about the first 4 chars... so any
     station with the first four that match will answer... ie all of them in
     your group.  The other method is to simply fly the plane overhead and
     listen (eavesdrop) on the channel and passively pickup the locations of the
     groups as they converse with one another.  The rino will send it's
     location just as you un-key the PTT if it has been >30 sec since the last
     time you sent your position.  It would be practical to simply ask each
     team for an update... they just need to squeeze their PTT for a moment
     (ie kerchunk) to send a position."


   16. Start up XASTIR and read the help files to configure it. If you have 
     problems, please consult the FAQ file.

     You can now start XASTIR. On most systems that the path is set up in
     FHS format just type "xastir". On other systems type
     "/usr/local/bin/xastir" to start the program.

     If you see errors at this point that say something like "Can't load
     xxx library" this means you forgot to either update /etc/ld.so.conf (or
     /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory on some systems) and run /sbin/ldconfig, or
     add the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable for your shell, and the "ld" loader
     can't link the libraries with the Xastir executable to get it running in
     memory.  Note that if you're running Xastir as SUID root, the
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable is ignored.

     To set a new language or change the language current choice, use
     this command line:

     xastir -l <language>

     Current choices are:

            Dutch English French German Italian Portuguese Spanish
            ElmerFudd MuppetsChef OldeEnglish PigLatin PirateEnglish

     This option will be stored in the users config file for the next time
     Xastir is run. On new installs Xastir will default to English unless
     you use this command line option.


   CONNECTING TO AN INTERNET SERVER:

   Here are some lists of Internet servers:

        http://members.aol.com/wa8lmf3/miscinfo/APRServe.txt
        http://www.wa6oft.com/APRServe.txt
        http://www.aprs-is.net/aprsservers.htm
        http://www.aprs-is.net/APRSServers.htm


   Filter port syntax (for those ports that allow user-selectable
   filtering):

        http://www.aprs-is.net/javaprssrvr/javaprsfilter.htm


   The procedure to connect to one of them is this:

    *) Select Interface->Properties.
    *) Click Add.
    *) Select Internet Server, click Add.
    *) Fill in the "Host" and "Port" boxes.
    *) Enter the Pass-code found by running "callpass" with your callsign
       in an xterm window.
    *) Set the togglebuttons and filter parameters per your preferences.  The
       "filter" keyword is added by Xastir, so you don't need to add that word
       to the box.  If the box has anything in it, "filter" is prepended to the
       text when Xastir sends the string to the server
    *) Optionally put in a comment.  That shows up in the Interface and
       Properties dialogs to remind you of the details for that connection.
    *) Click OK.

   A short list of the first-tier servers (you may want to connect to the
   second-tier servers or regional/local servers instead):

     first.aprs.net ports 10151 (history) or 10152 (no history)
     second.aprs.net ports 10151 (history) or 10152 (no history)
     third.aprs.net ports 10151 (history) or 10152 (no history)
     fourth.aprs.net ports 10151 (history) or 10152 (no history)


   FESTIVAL NOTE:  From: J. Lance Cotton:
   One thing that I found that I had to do to finally get festival to work was
   to get rid of the 'only localhost can connect to the server' pref in the
   festival configuration. I don't know if that's the default on a source
   install (I installed festival from RPM's), but it might be.
   
   I don't know why it doesn't let localhost connect, even though it's the
   only one specifically allowed.
   
   Here's what to do:  Open the 'festival.scm' file (I found mine in
   /usr/share/festival/' and look for the line that starts like:
   
       (defvar server_access_list ...
   
   Make it look like:
   
       (defvar server_access_list nil
   
   Then restart the festival server.
   -Lance KJ5O

   Additional note from Alan Crosswell:  If you run the festival_server
   script instead of festival -server, then the permissions for localhost
   get set up for you.


You probably want to download some maps and additional data files. The
instructions for this are in the README.MAPS.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS:
---------------------

Profiling:
----------
1) "./configure --with-profiling"

This will add "-pg" to the CFLAGS section of the Makefiles, which
turns on the collection of profiling data while the executable is
running (on Linux anyway).

2) "make clean"

3) "make install" (Don't do "make install-strip" here, as that will
strip off the symbol table information that gprof requires)

4) "xastir &"

5) Let Xastir run for some period of time.

6) Close Xastir

7) "gprof /usr/local/bin/xastir | tee profile.txt"

Gprof will use the Xastir binary and the gmon.out file created from
running Xastir to give you the profile listing.

Add the "-l" flag to the gprof line to give you a line-by-line
profile listing, but be prepared for a long run-time and a lot of
CPU to be used by gprof to generate it:

    "gprof -l /usr/local/bin/xastir | tee profile.txt"

Also see this link, which talks about how to profile multi-threaded
applications:

    http://sam.zoy.org/writings/programming/gprof.html

With the method described, you compile/install their library code,
then invoke Xastir like this:

    LD_PRELOAD=xastir/src/gprof-helper.so xastir &


    mv gmon.out gmon.old; gprof /usr/local/bin/xastir gmon.old \
    | tee profile.txt; gprof -l /usr/local/bin/xastir gmon.old \
    | tee profile2.txt


Checking for Memory Leaks:
--------------------------

A simple method for just checking malloc's/free's is to set
MALLOC_CHECK to a 1 or a 2, at least on Linux.  See the malloc man
page for more info.

For more thorough checks, use libgc:

1) Install libgc, the conservative garbage collector for C and C++.

SuSE packages needed are "libgc1" and "gc-devel". If you must compile
from sources instead, find libgc at:

    http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc

Configure/install libgc like this:

    ./configure --enable-threads=posix

Make sure that "-DGC_LINUX_THREADS" and "-D_REENTRANT" are defined
in the Makefile if you're compiling it on Linux.

Optional:  Change Makefile to add "-DSAVE_CALL_CHAIN" on the DEFS
line.  This will provide more of a stack trace each time a leak is
found.  This is sometimes useful but much more verbose.

    make
    make check
    su
    make install
    exit (from root)

2) Now, back in the xastir directory:

    ./configure --with-libgc

Make sure that "-fomit_frame_pointer" is _NOT_ in the Makefiles.
This will mess up the optional stack trace if present.

    make clean
    make install
    xastir &

Let Xastir run for some period of time.

Libgc will dump messages to the xterm as memory leaks are found.
Any Xastir memory leaks should have a filename and a line number
listed.  Memory leaks from lower-level libraries will be missing the
detailed information, so they are easy to spot (and mostly useless
for the purpose of finding and patching memory leaks).

Note also that libgc will take Xastir's memory usage up quite a bit,
so don't be surprised if Xastir uses two or three times the normal
amount of memory while you're debugging memory leaks with libgc.
