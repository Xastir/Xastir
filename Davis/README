Davis Weather Station support for Xastir - db2APRS


OVERVIEW
--------

This is a bridge utility between "meteo", a Davis Weather Station 
data storage & display application by Andreas Muller (see 
http://meteo.othello.ch) and "Xastir", the APRS package for
Linux (see http://www.xastir.org). It allows your Davis weather 
data to be used by Xastir for local station data.

You will need to obtain and install Xastir, mysql and meteo as 
outlined in the following sections. After Xastir and meteo are
in working order, this utility can be run as a daemon to provide 
weather data to Xastir (or any other APRS-format application).

"db2APRS" watches for new weather data in the database, retrieves
the new data, formats it in APRS "position less" ASCII format and
makes it available on a TCP port of your choosing. Xastir is 
capable of reading this data (see note under Xastir installation).


INSTALLATION
------------

Steps in order:

1) Install mysql - initial tested version mysql-3.23.58
   although version 4 is released and has some significant 
   improvements - and version 4 *should* work (to be tested yet). 
   If you use an RPM or DPK binary-image version, be sure to add 
   the mysql-devel headers. For the latest image-version, see 
   http://www.mysql.com and follow the links to the downloads. 
   I used mysql-3.23.58-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz from that site.   

2) Install meteo - tested versions meteo-0.9.4 and meteo-0.9.8
   Version 0.9.9 is available and based on the change documented
   will work. See the instructions for installing & then setting 
   up meteo that come with the tar ball. Obtain the latest meteo 
   at http://meteo.othello.ch - the setup is rather involved but
   worth the efort. Some SQL/XML skills can help here, but are 
   not absolutely required...

3) Install or update your installation for Xastir to the latest
   version (http://www.sourceforge.net, project Xastir) 

4) Install db2APRS -  version 0.1.2
   See instructions below.


SETTINGS & STARTUP
------------------

1) mysql - it is recommended by mysql to set up passwords, but for
   this usage it doesn't matter. In fact, it's a bit of a pain.
   TODO - db2APRS has the annoying fault of clearly displaying 
   the password used for the mysql database for anyone to see via 
   'ps -ef'. Start mysqld before db2APRS, meteo and Xastir in your 
   boot-time initializations.

2) meteo - my testing used a one minute data accumulation rate. 
   Thirty seconds would more closely match Xastir, but the 
   database growth rate would be twice as fast (about 600  
   Mbytes/year at 30 sec rate). Set your desired rate using the 
   meteopoll command line options. I run the full meteopoll 
   package with  averaging, graphs and meteodequeue - but the 
   only *required*  element is meteopoll. Start the meteopoll 
   daemon after mysqld is up. (meteodequeue is recommended - see 
   the doc's that come with meteo and man pages).

3) db2APRS - see "db2APRS RUN OPTIONS" below. Start this daemon 
   after mysqld and before Xastir. When meteopoll isn't running, 
   you will get old weather data, time stamped by Xastir as new 
   data.

4) xastir - start this last, if you are auto-opening the WX port.
   Set the weather port as a network weather station on 
   "localhost", port number as chosen in "db2APRS RUN OPTIONS" 
   (default is 1313). Make sure your station is set to one of the
   "w/weather data" and your Icon is set to a weather Icon.


db2APRS RUN OPTIONS
-------------------

The db2APRS utility takes standard short & long command line 
options, which can be displayed by "db2APRS -?". Here's the list:

  -h	--help	

      Show help info and exit.

  -v    --verbose

      Useful with the -n switch, for trouble-shooting, not for 
      normal operation. Tells you more than you really wanted to  
      know, but I recommend that you use this switch while you 
      try to initially set up db2APRS.

  -c	--cport [port#]

      Choose which TCP/IP port data comes out from. If not used,
      port number 1313 is the default. HINT: "telnet localhost 
      [port#]" is a handy way to verify db2APRS operation.

  -s	--sensor [sensor group#]

      Indicate what group of sensors are the outdoor ones. 
      If not supplied, sensor number 1 is the default. 
      HINT: Tables "station" and "sensor" in the meteo
      database control what your "sensor" (which means 
      sensor group) definitions are for your "station".
      
  -u 	--user [database user]	

      Username for mysql database connection. If unspecfied 
      defaults to "meteo" (which is per the meteo setup intended
      to be a read-only account for meteo).

  -p 	--password [db passwd]	

      Password for mysql connection. If unspecfied, no password  
      is supplied. NOTE: this password is unfortunately visible 
      to anyone on your system running 'ps -ef'. TO BE FIXED.

  -b 	--database [database]	

      Database name for mysql connection. If not supplied the 
      default is "meteo".

  -n	--nodaemon

      Run in the fore-ground as a program. Useful for debugging
      or initial setup, when used with -v.

  -r	--repeat
      
      Keep going till killed - if not specified, one pass is 
      performed and then db2APRS exits. The only case where this  
      switch is *not* used is during initial setup/debug.

Typical example: "./db2APRS -r -u meteo -p meteo" for normal use
or "./db2APRS -r -n -v -u test -p password" for debugging.


OPERATIONAL DETAILS
-------------------

db2APRS connects to the specified mysql database, extracts the 
latest timestamp and compares it to the last timestamp it read. 
If newer, the outdoor weather data (extception: air pressure is
taken as indoor=outdoor) bearing this timestamp is extracted 
and formatted in the APRS "position less" string format with a  
Davis and X-APRS tag on the end. Any connecting client is given 
this string at 25 second intervals, after new database entries 
are checked for.

This daemon could run on any networked Linux machine instead of 
the machine hosting Xastir, if desired (it's a good way around 
lack of processing power, disk space or serial ports!).

Note that the db2APRS daemon keeps providing data to Xastir even 
when no new entries in the database have been made. This could 
lead to errors in the timestamp on the data that Xastir is 
transmitting.


BUILD db2APRS
-------------

It's the usual:

$ cd xastir/Davis
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su -c 'make install'
