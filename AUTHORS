   Here we attempt to list most of the Xastir developers and contributors
   who have devoted large amounts of time to making Xastir one of the best
   APRS(tm) clients ever.  Unfortunately we can't devote much time to
   keeping this list current or adding new contributors.

   SmartBeaconing(tm) was invented by Tony Arnerich (KD7TA) and Steve
   Bragg (KA9MVA) for the HamHUD project.  They offer the algorithm to
   other authors as long as proper credit is given and the term
   SmartBeaconing(tm) is used to describe it.  So be it.  Thanks Tony
   and Steve!

   Thanks go to all the people who have made individual contributions to
   the Xastir project by sending bug-reports, patches, or who have
   otherwise supported the project.  There are too many to list.
