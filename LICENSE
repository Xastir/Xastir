   *) The code in the src/shapelib directory is an old version of shapelib
      that is built and used by Xastir only if an external shapelib is not
      already installed on the system.  This code is licensed under the LGPLv2.
      The LGPL terms are in src/shapelib/LICENSE.LGPL

-------------------------------
Xastir scripts
-------------------------------


*) Except where explicitly noted in comments, the scripts in the scripts
   directory are all licensed under the GPLv2.  Any script without
   explicit license information in its comments should be presumed to be GPLv2.
   Some of the programs in the scripts directory are provided under other
   open source licenses, and the licensing information will be present
   in script comments, which should be consulted for details:
      inf2geo.pl, mapfgd.pl, overlay.pl, ozi2geo.pl, permutations.pl,
      ridge_radar.pl, split_gnis.bash
          --- These are stated to be "Released into the Public Domain" by
              their respective authors.

-------------------------------
Additional license terms
-------------------------------

Some scripts in the scripts directory use the term "LSB."  These scripts
are all GPLv2 licensed, and contain the following caveats in their headers:

*) "Free Standards Group, FSG, Linux Standard Base, LSB, Free
   Standards Certified, LSB Certified and the Free Standards Certified
   logo are trademarks, service marks and certification marks, as
   appropriate, of Free Standards Group in the United States and in
   other countries."

   We are in no way representing that Xastir has been certified by the
   FSG.  To do so costs real money.  We do intend some Xastir binaries
   to install and run properly on LSB-3.0 compliant x86 Linux systems
   though.


-------------------------------
Third party library licenses
-------------------------------

Xastir may be built optionally with a number of third party libraries.
The licenses to these third party libraries are only relevant when
distributing a binary that has been built to include those libraries.

The remainder of this document consists of the license terms of these
various third party libraries.

*) libcurl (<http://curl.haxx.se/> is available under the following
license.  Note that this license is only applicable to a distributed

README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L.  Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

2.4  GLX Public License

GLX PUBLIC LICENSE (Version 1.0 (2/11/99)) ("License")

Subject to any third party claims, Silicon Graphics, Inc. ("SGI") hereby
grants permission to Recipient (defined below), under Recipient's copyrights
in the Original Software (defined below), to use, copy, modify, merge, pub-
lish, distribute, sublicense and/or sell copies of Subject Software (defined
below), and to permit persons to whom the Subject Software is furnished in
accordance with this License to do the same, subject to all of the following
terms and conditions, which Recipient accepts by engaging in any such use,
copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing or sell-
ing:

1. Definitions.

     (a) "Original Software" means source code of computer software code
     which is described in Exhibit A as Original Software.

     (b) "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the sub-
     stance or structure of either the Original Software or any previous
     Modifications. When Subject Software is released as a series of
     files, a Modification means (i) any addition to or deletion from
     the contents of a file containing Original Software or previous
     Modifications and (ii) any new file that contains any part of the
     Original Code or previous Modifications.

     (c) "Subject Software" means the Original Software or Modifications
     or the combination of the Original Software and Modifications, or
     portions of any of the foregoing.

     (d) "Recipient" means an individual or a legal entity exercising
     rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.
     For legal entities, "Recipient" includes any entity which controls,
     is controlled by, or is under common control with Recipient.  For
     purposes of this definition, "control" of an entity means (a) the
     power, direct or indirect, to direct or manage such entity, or (b)
     ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares
     or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2. Redistribution of Source Code Subject to These Terms.  Redistributions of
Subject Software in source code form must retain the notice set forth in
Exhibit A, below, in every file. A copy of this License must be included in
any documentation for such Subject Software where the recipients' rights
relating to Subject Software are described. Recipient may distribute the
source code version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's
choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that
(i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the
license terms include this Section 2 and Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13
of this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other
terms of such license. If Recipient distributes the source code version under
a different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI.
Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as
a result of any such terms Recipient offers.

3. Redistribution in Executable Form. The notice set forth in Exhibit A must
be conspicuously included in any notice in an executable version of Subject
Software, related documentation or collateral in which Recipient describes
the user's rights relating to the Subject Software. Recipient may distribute
the executable version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's
choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that
(i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the
license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of
this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other
terms of such license. If Recipient distributes the executable version under
a different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI.
Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as
a result of any such terms Recipient offers.

4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to
cure such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject
Software which is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense.  Provisions which,
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
shall survive.

5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any
trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or
service mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
the Subject Software without prior written permission of SGI.

6. No Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights with respect to
the OpenGL API or to any software or hardware implementation thereof or to
any other software whatsoever, nor shall any other rights or licenses not
expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise with
respect to the Subject Software. Title to and ownership of the Original Soft-
ware at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Software not
expressly granted under this License are reserved.

7. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. Recipient shall comply with all
applicable laws and regulations in connection with use and distribution of
the Subject Software, including but not limited to, all export and import
control laws and regulations of the U.S. government and other countries.
Recipient may not distribute Subject Software that (i) in any way infringes
(directly or contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade
secret, trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any
other person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty,
express, implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be
deemed to have been distributed.

8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one
or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribu-
tion, import or sale of Subject Software (including particular functionality
or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's intel-
lectual property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page
bearing the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description
of the party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the
Subject Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim.  Also, upon
gaining such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously
include the URL for such web page in the Exhibit A notice required under Sec-
tions 2 and 3, above, and in the text of any related documentation, license
agreement or collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights relat-
ing to the Subject Software. If Recipient obtains such knowledge after it
makes Subject Software available to any other person or entity, Recipient
shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or news-
groups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Subject Soft-
ware that new knowledge has been obtained.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MER-
CHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON- INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD ANY SOFTWARE
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR ANY SER-
VICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THE-
ORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIA-
BILITY), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR
ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.
Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc.
from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including
the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient's use,
modification, reproduction and distribution of the Subject Software or out of
any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

12. U.S. Government End Users. The Subject Software is a "commercial item"
consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms are defined in
title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations and all U.S.  Government End
Users acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to
the terms of this License.

13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning

CID FONT CODE PUBLIC LICENSE (Version 1.0 (3/31/99))("License")

Subject to any applicable third party claims, Silicon Graphics, Inc.  ("SGI")
hereby grants permission to Recipient (defined below), under SGI's copyrights
in the Original Software (defined below), to use, copy, modify, merge, pub-
lish, distribute, sublicense and/or sell copies of Subject Software (defined
below) in both source code and executable form, and to permit persons to whom
the Subject Software is furnished in accordance with this License to do the
same, subject to all of the following terms and conditions, which Recipient
accepts by engaging in any such use, copying, modifying, merging, publica-
tion, distributing, sublicensing or selling:

1. Definitions.

     a. "Original Software" means source code of computer software code
     that is described in Exhibit A as Original Software.

     b. "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the sub-
     stance or structure of either the Original Software or any previous
     Modifications. When Subject Software is released as a series of
     files, a Modification means (i) any addition to or deletion from
     the contents of a file containing Original Software or previous
     Modifications and (ii) any new file that contains any part of the
     Original Code or previous Modifications.

     c. "Subject Software" means the Original Software or Modifications
     or the combination of the Original Software and Modifications, or
     portions of any of the foregoing.

     d. "Recipient" means an individual or a legal entity exercising
     rights under the terms of this License. For legal entities, "Recip-

     under common control with Recipient. For purposes of this defini-
     tion, "control" of an entity means (i) the power, direct or indi-
     rect, to direct or manage such entity, or (ii) ownership of fifty
     percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial own-
     ership of such entity.

     e. "Required Notice" means the notice set forth in Exhibit A to
     this License.

     f. "Accompanying Technology" means any software or other technology
     that is not a Modification and that is distributed or made publicly
     available by Recipient with the Subject Software.  Separate soft-
     ware files that do not contain any Original Software or any previ-
     ous Modification shall not be deemed a Modification, even if such
     software files are aggregated as part of a product, or in any
     medium of storage, with any file that does contain Original Soft-
     ware or any previous Modification.

2. License Terms. All distribution of the Subject Software must be made sub-
ject to the terms of this License. A copy of this License and the Required
Notice must be included in any documentation for Subject Software where
Recipient's rights relating to Subject Software and/or any Accompanying Tech-
nology are described. Distributions of Subject Software in source code form
must also include the Required Notice in every file distributed. In addition,
a ReadMe file entitled "Important Legal Notice" must be distributed with each
distribution of one or more files that incorporate Subject Software.  That
file must be included with distributions made in both source code and exe-
cutable form. A copy of the License and the Required Notice must be included
in that file.  Recipient may distribute Accompanying Technology under a
license of Recipient's choice, which may contain terms different from this
License, provided that (i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this
License, (ii) such other license terms do not modify or supersede the terms
of this License as applicable to the Subject Software, (iii) Recipient hereby
indemnifies SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result of the distri-
bution of Accompanying Technology or the use of other license terms.

3. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to
cure such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject
Software that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense.  Provisions which,
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
shall survive.

4. Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any trade
name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or ser-
vice mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote products derived from or
incorporating any Subject Software without prior written permission of SGI.

5. No Other Rights. No rights or licenses not expressly granted hereunder
shall arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise. Title to and ownership of
the Original Software at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Origi-
nal Software not expressly granted under this License are reserved.

6. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. Recipient shall comply with all
applicable laws and regulations in connection with use and distribution of
the Subject Software, including but not limited to, all export and import
control laws and regulations of the U.S. government and other countries.
Recipient may not distribute Subject Software that (i) in any way infringes
(directly or contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade
secret, trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any
other person or entity, or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty,
express, implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be
deemed to have been distributed.

7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one
or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribu-
tion, import or sale of Subject Software (including particular functionality
or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's intel-
lectual property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page
bearing the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description
of the party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the
Subject Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim.  Also, upon
gaining such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously
include the URL for such web page in the Required Notice, and in the text of
any related documentation, license agreement or collateral in which Recipient
describes end user's rights relating to the Subject Software. If Recipient
obtains such knowledge after it makes Subject Software available to any other
person or entity, Recipient shall take other steps (such as notifying appro-
priate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to provide such
knowledge to those who received the Subject Software.

8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MER-
CHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD ANY SOFTWARE

VICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY),
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE OR
THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT TO THE EXTENT SO DISALLOWED.

10. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.
Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold SGI and its successors and assigns
harmless from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses
(including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of (Recipi-
ent's use, modification, reproduction and distribution of the Subject Soft-
ware or out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

11. U.S. Government End Users. The Subject Software is a "commercial item"
consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms are defined in
title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations and all U.S. Government End Users
acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to the
terms of this License.

12. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unen-
forceable by any judicial or administrative authority having proper jurisdic-
tion with respect thereto, such provision shall be reformed so as to achieve
as nearly as possible the same economic effect as the original provision and
the remainder of this License will remain in effect. This License shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States
and the State of California as applied to agreements entered into and to be
performed entirely within California between California residents.  Any liti-
gation relating to this License shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdic-
tion of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California (or, absent

costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the

    hereby grants Recipient a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
    license, to do the following: (i) under copyrights Licensable by SGI,
    to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works from, and, to the
    extent applicable, display and perform the Original Code and/or any

    and (ii) under any Licensable Patents, to make, have made, use, sell,

    and conditions of this License by undertaking any of the aforementioned
    actions. The patent license shall apply to the Covered Code if, at the

    Patents. The patent license in Section 2.1(ii) shall not apply to any
    other combinations that include the Modification.  No patent license is
    provided under SGI Patents for infringements of SGI Patents by

    Modifications not provided by SGI.

    2.2. Recipient License Grant. Subject to the terms of this License and
    any third party intellectual property claims, Recipient hereby grants
    SGI and any other Recipients a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
    license, under any Recipient Patents, to make, have made, use, sell,
    offer for sale, import and/or otherwise transfer the Original Code
    and/or any Modifications provided by SGI.

    2.3. No License For Hardware Implementations. The licenses granted in

    Exhibit A, below, must be conspicuously retained or included in any and
    all redistributions of Covered Code. For distributions of the Covered
    Code in source code form, the Notice must appear in every file that can
    include a text comments field; in executable form, the Notice and a
    copy of this License must appear in related documentation or collateral
    where the Recipient's rights relating to Covered Code are described.
    Any Additional Notice Provisions which actually appears in the Original
    Code must also be retained or included in any and all redistributions
    of Covered Code.

    3.2. Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance with
    the terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as without derogation
    of any of SGI's rights in and to the Original Code, distribute the
    source code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under (1) this
    License; (2) a license identical to this License but for only such
    changes as are necessary in order to clarify Recipient's role as
    licensor of Modifications; and/or (3) a license of Recipient's
    choosing, containing terms different from this License, provided that
    the license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12,
    and 13, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other
    terms of such license. If Recipient elects to use any license other
    than this License, Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of
    its terms which differ from this License are offered by Recipient
    alone, and not by SGI. It is emphasized that this License is a limited
    license, and, regardless of the license form employed by Recipient in
    accordance with this Section 3.2, Recipient may relicense only such
    rights, in Original Code and Modifications by SGI, as it has actually
    been granted by SGI in this License.

    3.3. Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any
    liability incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative license
    terms Recipient offers.

4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to
cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any sublicense to the Covered Code
that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this License,
absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License,
shall survive.

5. No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights to:
(i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any other rights or
licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or
otherwise with respect to the Covered Code; (ii) any trade name, trademark
or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any related right

intellectual property rights of any kind of any other person or entity or
(ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or
statutory, to which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have
been subject.

7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim
that any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or
partially infringes the third party's intellectual property rights,
Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.

8. Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of
the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to use it
under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code under
the terms of any subsequent version published by SGI. Subject to the
provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the
terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS." ALL EXPRESS
