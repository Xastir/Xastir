# Test log file for weather alerts.  Bring this file into Xastir via
# the Open Log File option and within 30-60 seconds you should see
# the alerts light up.  All except the first one listed here which
# has a matching cancel:  See that alert as cancelled in the
# View->Weather Alerts dialog.
#
# If using this file during the early part of a month you must
# change the date stamp ("30" here) to numbers closer to your
# current date but into the future a bit.  Note that these are UTC
# date/times.  You must be within XX days (mod 31) to see the
# alerts, else Xastir assumes the date was from the previous month
# and discards them.  The alert must be within 0-10 days into the
# future (UTC) in order to be displayed, per
# util.c:time_from_aprsstring()
#
# Note:  If commenting out sentences you'll need to use more than
# just one a '#' mark.  "####" seems to work fine (4 chars).



# Test individual alerts, with only one area lit up per message.

# Alert level tests, color specifies alert level:
# -----------------------------------------------
# First we do an active alert and a cancel.  This should not display
# on the map, but CANCL messages show in the View WX Alerts dialog.
# If the alert did show, it would be lighting up the San Juan
# Islands (upper Puget Sound) in Blue.
