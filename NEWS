Whats new, first read the following documents:

     INSTALL
     README
     ChangeLog

All of these documents combined will fill you in on the latest changes to
xastir in version 0.4.x.

A lot of things have changed in this version so at a minimum read the
ChangeLog text file. ChangeLog shows whats been added and fixed along the
way.

This version includes a "first try" at using the GNU Autotools for
configuration.  These scripts have not been throughly tested on all
platforms.  Any feedback is actively solicited.

This version also includes several additional directories added in
preparation for the implementation of GNU internationalization
routines.


CAUTION:

     1. Before you start Xastir for the first time BACKUP your
     data files if this is an upgrade from a previous version.

     2. DON'T USE YOUR OLD CONFIG FILE.. MAKE A NEW ONE.........
