This file has three parts.  The first part describes the new structure for
debug levels.  The second part describes the debug_level definitions that
were in the old code and which files they were in.  The third part
describes how to use use debugging at run time.  The debug level structure
was modified in February of 2002 by KB6MER.  Questions/comments/flames can
be sent to kb6mer@arrl.net

Here's how things are after KB6MER tweaked it all...

New Scheme:
-----------
1       General basic debugging (any system)
2       Messages, WX, Objects, and Items, Port Data Flow
4       X Object Debugging
8       X Window Object Debugging
16      Map Debugging (maps.c)
32      Language Debugging (maps.c)
64      Database Object Debugging
128     GPS Interface Detailed debugging
256     station and trail display detailed debugging
512     Map import/export function debugging
1024    Internet Transaction debugging
2048    ALOHA radius and Multipoint object debugging.

4096    Levels 4096 and above will require modification to the
        main.c:Change_debug_level_change_data() function to change
        the bounds checking, and are available for future use.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Old Scheme:
-----------
Places where debug level is referenced in old code, and the levels
referenced (if debug_level xx), where xx is >0, &1, etc.

alert.c >0
bulletin_gui.c &1
db.c >=2 &1 &128 &32 &256 ()
gps.c &128
hostname.c &256
igate.c &2
interface.c &128 &2 &1
interface_gui.c &128
lang.c &32
main.c &4 <0/>255(need to change limits) &8 &128 &1 &15
maps.c &16 &2 >=2 &4 &1 &8
messages.c >1 &1 >5
messages_gui.c &2
track_gui.c >=2
util.c &1
wx.c >2 &1
xa_config.c &1 &2

How to Use the Debug Levels

Xastir debugging is turned on at run time by using the "-v" command line
option and/or the File -> Configure -> Change Debug Level pull-down. 
 
As laid out above, in the source code, debugging output is turned on by a
bitwise "and" (&) of the currently set DEBUG_LEVEL against a number
appropriate to the module currently being executed. 

For example, in the "maps.c" the following lines appear: 

    if ( debug_level & 512 )
        fprintf(stderr,"Creating %s\n", xpm_filename );

The highest debug level for Xastir is 4095, and debug levels are additive. 
If you want to have "general basic debugging" and "GPS interface Detail"
and "Map Debugging" you'd use:

1 + 128 + 512 = 641

xastir -v 641 

Debug information typically is sent to "standard error" - which is normally
File Descriptor #2 in Unix parlance.  Using common Unix shells, such as
Bash, you can "redirect" the output to be intermingled with the "standard
output" (file descriptor #1).  This allows you to get all of the normal
output, plus all of the debug output in one stream, which can be "piped" to
another command, such as grep.  This can used to search for specific items
in the debug output. 

For example, to check debug information to see whether or not map caching
is working, you can turn on debug level 512, redirect stderr to stdout and
the grep for map cache specific output:

xastir -v 512 2>&1 |grep map_cache

Another little trick, to be used when you're running programs that
call other programs, or scripts that call other scripts/programs:

    (xastir -v 512 2>&1) | grep map_cache

The parenthesis cause that portion to be run in a sub-shell, and then
that sub-shell's STDERR is piped to STDOUT by the "2>&1" portion, so
you get ANYTHING that went to STDERR or STDOUT from that command or
anything that it calls.  This is how you can get a "make" command to
spit everything into one file.

Of course you can also do:

    (xastir -v 512 2>&1) | tee xastir.log

Which will pipe everything to your screen and to the xastir.log
file.  You could then type "tail -f xastir.log | grep map_cache" in
another window and watch that subset of the error messages there.
That way you won't miss anything.
