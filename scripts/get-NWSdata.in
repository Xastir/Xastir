# After download/install of map files above, run commands such as these:
#
#   cd /usr/local/share/xastir; testdbfawk -D config -d Counties/mz11au16.dbf 2>&1 | head -5
#   cd /usr/local/share/xastir; testdbfawk -D config -d Counties/w_11au16.dbf 2>&1 | head -5
#
# to determine whether there's dbfawk support for each of the NWS files. NWS
# changes the signature on their files often so we need to create a new
# dbfawk for each in xastir/config, test it, then add it into the
# Makefile.am file there and commit, then do another "make install" to put
# the dbfawk's into place.
# Fixed the issue where there's an 'a' or 'b' after the filename root. NWS likes
# to do that, but have non-a/b files extracted from the zip, which made the below
# tests fail.
