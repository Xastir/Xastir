# Converts "dump1090" telnet port output to Xastir UDP input.  This script will
# parse packets containing lat/long, turn them into APRS-like packets, then use
# "xastir_udp_client" to inject them into Xastir. Must have "dump1090" running,
# and optionally "dump978" to dump packets into "dump1090" from the other
# frequency/protocol for ADS-B.
#
#
# TODO: Create probability circle around my position for aircraft sending altitude
# but no lat/long. Change the size of the circle based on altitude and/or RSSI
# (Need to tie into Beast-mode port, raw data port, or JSON port to get RSSI).
# Would need to keep track of these objects and kill them when the aircraft timed-out
# or sent lat/long. Could switch back to the circle when lat/long times out but
# altitude is still coming in as well.
#
# TODO: Check everywhere that we set a variable to "". Make sure we're not setting
# it when a sentence including it comes in, then resetting it on all other sentences
# so that it never gets seen. "squawk_txt" and "squawk" were 2 of these.
# Check everywhere that $fields[] are checked/saved/used.
#
# TODO: Expire data values from hashes XX minutes after receiving them.
#
#
# Invoke it as:
#   ./ads-b.pl planes <passcode>
# or
#   ./ads-b.pl p1anes <passcode>
#
# If you add " --circles" to the end you'll also get a red circle around plane
# symbols at your current location which represent the area that a plane might
# be min, if it's only reporting altitude and not lat/long.
#
# Injecting them from "planes" or "p1anes" assures that Xastir won't try to adopt
# the APRS Item packets as its own and re-transmit them.
#
#
# I got the "dump1090" program from here originally:
#       https://github.com/antirez/dump1090
# Newer fork:
#       https://github.com/MalcolmRobb/dump1090
# Newer-yet fork, seems to decode much better:
#       https://github.com/mutability/dump1090
#
# Invoke Mutability's "dump1090" program like so:
#   "./dump1090 --interactive --net --net-sbs-port 30003 --phase-enhance --oversample --fix
#
#
# Note: There's also "dump978" which listens to 978 MHz ADS-B transmissions. You can
# invoke "dump1090" as above, then invoke "dump978" like this:
#
#       rtl_sdr -f 978000000 -s 2083334 -g 0 -d 1 - | ./dump978 | ./uat2esnt | nc -q1 localhost 30001
#
# which will convert the 978 MHz packets into ADS-B ES packets and inject them into "dump1090"
# for decoding. I haven't determined yet whether those packets will come out on "dump1090"'s
# port 30003 (which this Perl script uses). The above command also uses RTL device 1 instead of 0.
# If you're only interested in 978 MHz decoding, there's a way to start "dump1090" w/o a
# device attached, then start "dump978" and connect it to "dump1090".
#
# Then invoke this script in another xterm using "planes" as the callsign:
#   "./ads-b.pl planes <passcode>"
#
# NOTE: Do NOT use the same callsign as your Xastir instance, else it will
# "adopt" those APRS Item packets as its own and retransmit them. Code was
# added to the script to prevent such operation, but using "planes" as the
# callsign works great too!
#
#
# This script snags packets from port 30003 of "dump1090", parses them, then injects
# APRS packets into Xastir's UDP port (2023) if "Server Ports" are enabled in Xastir.
#
#
# Port 30001 is an input port (dump978 connects there and dumps data in).
#
# Port 30002 outputs in raw format, like:
#   *8D451E8B99019699C00B0A81F36E;
#   Every entry is separated by a simple newline (LF character, hex 0x0A).
#   The "callsign" (6 digits of hex) in chunk #4 = ICAO (airframe identifier).
