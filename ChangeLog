	* ChangeLog
	Xastir project stopped updating the ChangeLogs in 2012, and
	until then the changelog was generated manually from CVS
	history.  The project no longer uses CVS, and  now relies on git
	history to show the history of the project.  Please see the output
	of "git log" if you want to know what has happened to the code and
	why, and add the "--name-status" option if you want to know
	what files were changed.

	* src/: interface.c, interface_gui.c, xa_config.c: The rest of the
	  code to implement "TNC Delay" for the serial tnc types of
	  interfaces.  This is most useful with a KAM TNC.  Note that one
	  can hand edit the value up to 9,999,999 us in the Xastir config
	  file, but pressing the togglebutton will enter 1,000,000 us by
	  default.  Thanks for that idea Tom!

	  actually uses the button value hasn't been coded yet.

2012-10-11 11:25  we7u

	* scripts/get-fcc-rac.pl: Fixing the RAC database fetch/install.

2012-10-11 11:09  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata: Updating for the current set of NWS
	  filenames.

2012-10-11 10:58  tvrusso

	* symbols/: Makefile.am, icon.png: Add a PNG icon for Xastir,
	  converted from the icon.xbm file in the src directory.

	  I did this because I generally create a desktop shortcut to
	  Xastir on my laptop, and as of the most recent version of Gnome I
	  am unable to use an xbm to do so, but a PNG works.

	  This new icon is installed into ${prefix}/share/xastir/symbols
	  and may be used by the user to define a custom icon for a desktop
	  shortcut.

	  Remember, the Xastir project does not directly support
	  distro-specific (or desktop-specific) packages, but we do want to
	  make sure that those who generate such packages have the tools
	  and files they need to do so.

2012-10-10 15:18  tvrusso

	* help/: help-Dutch.dat, help-Portuguese.dat: The Dutch and
	  Portuguese help files were actually not in Dutch or Portuguese,
	  but English, and were woefully outdated.

	  Copied the current English helpfile into those two, so at least
	  the only thing that's wrong with them would be that they're not
	  in the language they're supposed to be.

2012-10-10 15:16  tvrusso

	* ChangeLog, help/help-English.dat: Regenerate ChangeLog from CVS
	  logs.

	  Add a "what's new in Xastir 2.0.1" section to the on-line help.

	  Looking over our non-English helpfiles, it is clear that it has
	  been a very long time since anyone has translated the help into
	  other languages.  The German help file hasn't been updated since
	  Xastir 1.2, Spanish hasn't been updated since 1.1, and several
	  languages have help files, but they're still in English.

2012-10-10 14:46  tvrusso

	* scripts/cvs2cl.pl: Add cvs2cl script (from
	  http://www.red-bean.com/cvs2cl/cvs2cl.pl) to our tools.  This
	  generates a ChangeLog from cvs commit logs.

2012-10-07 10:41  tvrusso

	* configure.ac: Move probe for proj to before probe for shapelib.
	  When using internal shapelib, the probe checks whether "use_proj"
	  is "yes", but until this commit, use_proj was unset until *AFTER*
	  the shapelib probe.  This led to warnings from the shell about
	  unary "=" in a test (if test $use_proj = "yes")

2012-10-05 13:19  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata: Updating a file or two, and changing the
	  order of FILE1 and FILE2 in the definitions to match the order
	  they are on the NWS web pages.  We will need to check this file
	  again on/after Oct 11 as several of the filenames change then.

2012-10-05 12:56  we7u

	* scripts/get-fcc-rac.pl: Changing the RAC address to one that
	  currently works.  The old site looks to have a brand spanking new
	  version of Drupal on it, so they may have messed up the rest of
	  the machine temporarily (or permanently).

2012-09-26 21:15  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Remove some unnecessary macros from
	  the probes for Berkeley DB.

	  The code in acinclude.m4 to probe for Berkeley DB was copied from
	  another project, and included a macro that tried to guess how to
	  add a "runpath" to the build.  On most systems this is either
	  -Rlibrarydirectory or -Wl,rpath,librarydirectory, but the macro
	  in our acinclude.m4 was in fact correctly identifying the way to
	  do it ONLY on Linux, and then discarding the information anyway.
	  Thus, this was a no-op on Linux, and was wrong elsewhere (but
	  also a no-op).  The technique used to do the probe also broke
	  when the compiler was clang, but again, to no effect because the
	  result was discarded anyway.

	  SO since the result wasn't used, why probe it?  I have removed
	  the macros and replaced the use of "XASTIR_ADD_LIBRARY_TO" with a
	  simple shell variable assignment.

	  While I was at it, I removed the deprecated two-argument call to
	  AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.  It has started causing newer versions of
	  automake to complain, and has been deprecated for some time.

2012-09-23 09:19  tvrusso

	* src/: db.c, fcc_data.c, igate.c, interface.c, location_gui.c,
	  main.c, map_OSM.c, map_WMS.c, map_cache.c, map_geo.c, map_shp.c,
	  map_tiger.c, maps.c, messages.c, messages_gui.c, objects.c,
	  rac_data.c, track_gui.c, util.c, xa_config.c, xa_config.h: Big
	  commit for a little, insidious threading problem.

	  xa_config.c provides a function called get_user_base_dir(char*)
	  that returns a pointer to a string that is the concatenation of
	  the base configuration directory for Xastir (usually ~/.xastir,
	  but selectable by the user with a command line option or
	  environment variable) and the argument.

	  This function was highly thread-unsafe --- it kept a local static
	  char array that it used to build the concatenated string, then
	  returned a pointer to the local array.

	  This function was used in multiple threads, meaning that one
	  thread could start scribbling into the static array while another
	  was writing into it.	I first tried to fix this by adding a mutex
	  that locked the writes for all but one thread at a time, but that
	  wasn't even good enough, because after unlocking the write mutex
	  another thread could write into the buffer while the first thread
	  was reading the results just produced.

	  The result of this mess was a highly unpredictable tendency for
	  Xastir to start producing corrupted paths from this function.
	  This would show up most often on multi-core machines with
	  threading libraries that let threads run simultaneously on
	  different cores, but it could show up on single-core machines
	  with just the right scheduler.  It is revealed most easily by
	  enabling multiple logging options (e.g. TNC logging, NET logging,
	  WX logging) and PNG snapshots all at once.  In testing, I found
	  this sufficient to produce corrupted file paths in an hour or so.
	   I'm somewhat surprised that nobody has ever reported this issue,
	  because I've been seeing it for ages.

	  This commit replaces the original get_user_base_dir
	  implementation with one that requires the caller to provide its
	  own buffer, and completely removes the use of the static buffer.
	  More than 200 calls to get_user_base_dir had to be modified, but
	  some simplifcation was also possible --- I was able to replace a
	  few usages like this:

	     xastir_snprintf(dest_string, sizeof(dest_string), "%s",
	  get_user_base_dir("tmp"));

	  with:    get_user_base_dir("tmp", dest_string,
	  sizeof(dest_string));

	  get_user_base_dir still returns the pointer to the destination
	  string, so it can still be used as an argument to log_data or
	  xastir_snprintf where necessary.

	  I also replaced several wasteful uses of the function.  There
	  were places where get_user_base_dir was being called repeatedly
	  with the same argument many times in a single function.  I
	  replaced this usage in many cases with a single call to store the
	  answer in a local buffer, and use that repeatedly.

	  Since implementing this change I have seen Xastir run without
	  producing a single corrupted path, even with TNC, NET, and WX
	  logging and PNG snapshots turned on.

2012-09-21 18:32  tvrusso

	* configure.ac, src/main.c: Ifdef out the hack added to main.c to
	  deal with the broken Xorg-server 1.7.5.  This server version had
	  a bug that interfered with all motif programs, causing them to
	  grab the cursor and never release it when a context (pop-up) menu
	  was created.	The bug was promptly fixed, but not before several
	  distros locked in version 1.7.5 as their supported version.

	  The workaround ungrabs the cursor, but has the annoying
	  side-effect of making the user hold down the button that brings
	  up the menu, rather than allowing a quick click to access it.

	  This commit puts the hack into an ifdef, and enables the user to
	  select the workaround by adding "--with-xorg_175_workaround" to
	  the configure line.  The default behavior is now to NOT use the
	  workaround.

	  The workaround and configure.ac code to enable it should be
	  removed completely in one release cycle.  Xorg-server 1.7.5 is
	  long gone, and keeping this code around is a nod to the fact that
	  some people do not upgrade for years.  One more release cycle
	  should be enough to forget this mistake ever happened.

2012-09-20 22:11  tvrusso

	* src/map_OSM.c: Patch from Tom Hayward (KD7LXL):

	  This patch fixes an issue in the OSM tile download loop. If a
	  tile is 404, 403, or any other error that doesn't return a valid
	  image, imagemagick (or gm) puts the error info in &exception.
	  Subsequent iterations read &exception, note the error, and fail
	  to composite any further tiles. This patch adds
	  GetExceptionInfo() to the end of the loop, so subsequent
	  iterations do not start off with error info in the exception
	  struct.

2012-09-19 07:56  tvrusso

	* Davis/src/db2APRS.c, LaCrosse/src/open2300db2APRS.c: Make sure to
	  include <sys/stat.h> before using umask(), to avoid compiler
	  warning about implicit declaration.

2012-09-14 13:57  tvrusso

	* config/tnc-startup.kam, src/interface.c: Definitive fix for KAM
	  TNCs.

	  The KAM apparently does not go into converse mode if one sends
	  "K\r" and immediately sends the stuff you want to go into the
	  converse.  It requires a tiny delay between the command to go
	  into converse mode and the data.

	  I have inserted a 50ms delay after sending the converse command,
	  which should be insignificant enough that nobody will need it to
	  be a configurable option.

	  This fix has been confirmed to end the problems with KAM TNCs,
	  and the 50ms delay was the smallest delay tested.

	  Also commented out two commands in tnc-startup.kam that do not
	  apparently exist in the KAM.

2012-09-08 15:07  tvrusso

	* Davis/src/db2APRS.c: Reverting my last change to the Davis
	  Meteo->APRS glue program.  This is in response to testing by Dean
	  Groe, who is so far the only person on the xastir mailing list
	  who has fed back any information about the behavior of the code
	  after my last commit.

	  Turns out that Meteo does not appear to put "Total Rain" (rain
	  since station reset) into the database in the "raintotal" field,
	  it appears to put "rain since midnight" there, i.e. "total rain
	  for today."  This is not what Xastir means, since it has a
	  separate spot for "today's rain."

	  Thus, it is pointless to be sending the extra data to Xastir,
	  because it is a duplicate of something else we already have.

	  I am changing only the Davis database glue program, and leaving
	  in place the LaCrosse changes --- LaCrosse stations *do* maintain
	  their own record of "total rain" and open2300 does put that data
	  into the database.  It's just Meteo that doesn't.

2012-08-31 16:39  tvrusso

	* Davis/configure.ac, Davis/src/db2APRS.c,
	  LaCrosse/src/open2300db2APRS.c, src/wx.c: Fix for Davis and
	  LaCrosse weather stations.

	  Neither of the two "db2APRS" programs for these stations provided
	  "total rain" (rain since wx station reset), and thus Xastir would
	  show a blank in the Own Weather Data dialog box for this.

	  Further, LaCrosse weather stations don't report
	  rain-since-midnight, and by not having total rain available,
	  Xastir isn't able to compute the missing datum.

	  This commit does three things:

	    adds total rain to the string that db2APRS and open2300db2APRS
	  send
	    adds code to Xastir to parse the new bit of data
	    adds code to Xastir to compute rain-since-midnight if total
	  rain
		  is available AND rain-since-midnight is not sent from the
	  wx station.

	  WARNING:  THE CODE FOR db2APRS has NOT been tested except to
	  assure that it compiles cleanly.  I have no Davis weather station
	  to test it on.

	  The LaCrosse code runs correctly.

	  src/interface_gui.c, src/main.c: Remove a horrid work-around of
	  some bad behavior of Xastir with Kenwood D7* radios with attached
	  GPS.

	  Back in 2006, several Xastir users noticed that when Xastir was
	  attached to a Kenwood D700 (and other Kenwood APRS radios) using
	  the "TNC with GPS on AUX port" interface type, every time Xastir
	  tried to transmit the TNC would reply with an "Eh?" error when
	  sent the MYCALL line that precedes a posit.  We realized that
	  there must be some kind of junk in the TNC buffer that was
	  causing the MYCALL line to not be recognized.  In some cases,
	  this had bad consequences, especially if no previous MYCALL had
	  succeeded --- the result would be that the TNC would transmit
	  using the default MYCALL, "NOCALL".

	  Since we couldn't for the life of us figure out what the junk in
	  the buffer was, we kludged:  Before sending MYCALL, Xastir would
	  send a carriage return, letting the "eh?" error happen where it
	  had no consequence.

	  This was a horrid kludge, as it just swept the real problem under
	  the rug.

	  The real issue is that "Serial TNC with GPS on AUX port" was
	  written to support devices like the Kantronics KPC-3+, which
	  requires that Xastir send a Control-E to the TNC in order to poll
	  it for GPS data.  This is how the KPC-3+ multiplexes the output
	  serial port --- normally it sends packet data to the serial port,
	  but immediately after receiving a Control-E from the connected
	  computer, it sends one NMEA string from the GPS instead.

	  The Kenwwood radios stream the GPS data and packet data together
	  all the time, and not only do not require a Control-E to switch
	  between them, they don't even read the Control-Es.

	  The "Eh?" errors from the Kenwood TNCs were it complaining that
	  MYCALL was preceded by all those Control-E characters that Xastir
	  had been sending since the last transmit.

	  This commit adds a configuration option to the Serial TNC with
	  GPS on AUX port set-up dialog so that one can turn this control-E
	  feature on and off as appropriate.

	  THIS HAS USER-VISIBLE IMPACT FOR ALL KENWOOD USERS:

	  If you are currently using Xastir with a Kenwood radio, after
	  doing this update you MUST open your interface property dialog
	  and de-select the 'Send Control-E to get GPS data?" check box.
	  If you do NOT take this step, you will begin seeing the old "Eh?"
	  problem on your TNC, and may well transmit your posit as NOCALL.

	  This may seem an annoyance, but really, this is the fix that we
	  should have put in place six years ago.

	* src/db.c: Fix two instances of a logical AND being used where a
	  bit-wise AND was intended.

	  In this case, the test was supposed to be checking that a station
	  posit was not a third-party packet, but was improperly doing flag
	  && ST_3RD_PT instead of flag & ST_3RD_PT.

	  This impacts ONLY speech-enabled band opening alerts.  It is
	  unlikely that anyone was even using these.  I found this error
	  only because clang spits out warnings about it.  The specific
	  warning is that one is attempting to do a logical AND with a
	  constant value (which is more likely an error than intentional).

2012-08-13 10:22  tvrusso

	* src/: database.h, wx.c: EXPERIMENTAL COMMIT FOR TESTING PURPOSES.

	  This commit modifies the weather station code so taht stations
	  which provide 1-hour, 24-hour, and since-midnight rain rates
	  (e.g. Davis through Meteo and db2APRS, LaCrosse, and Davis APRS
	  Data Logger) do not have those station- provided data overwritten
	  by Xastir when it tries to recalculate these quantities from
	  "total rain" (i.e. total rainfall since the weather station was
	  reset).

	  The Davis Meteo/LaCrosse code does not even provide "total
	  rainfall" information (though the database they access does in
	  fact have this information), and the APRS Data Logger does not
	  provide total rainfall.  All three provide per-hour and 24-hour
	  rain data, and the Data Logger provides rain-since -midnight.

	  What this code does is add a flag to the WeatherRow structure
	  that is set to 1 by stations that provide total rain, and to zero
	  by stations that provide the rate data instead.  In
	  "cycle_weather", the three rate strings are only overwritten if
	  the flag is 1, and are left as the station set them if the flag
	  is 0.

	  This should address issues of transmitted rain rates being
	  completely incorrect for Davis and LaCrosse stations.

	  Needs a lot more testing to assure that there is no impact on
	  other stations.  This code should result in no change in Xastir's
	  behavior for any station other than Davis or LaCrosse.

	* src/: main.c, xa_config.c: Patch by Tom Hayward.

	  This commit allows the "posit interval" slider to go all the way
	  to zero.  If zero, Xastir will not emit timed beacons.

	  It also adds a SIGUSR2 signal handler.  If Xastir receives a
	  SIGUSR2, it will beacon immediately.

	  This commit provides all the functionality requested by David
	  Ranch on the Xastir mailing list in this post:

	* src/: interface.c, interface.h: Remove commented-out, hard-coded
	  choices of 'conv' and 'k' to put a TNC into "converse" mode.	The
	  Interface Properties dialog now allows a user to specify this at
	  run time, and the presence of this commented-out code was
	  confusing some users into thinking they still might need to edit
	  source code to change it.

	* LaCrosse/weatherdump.sql: Modify mysql database for LaCrosse to
	  support more digits of precision for wind direction and other
	  data that can exceed 99.9.

	  "decimal(3,1)" means 3 digits with one past the decimal, i.e.
	  +/-99.9.  It was being used for fields that could take values
	  well outside this range.

	  I know that in at least one prior incarnation, this usage
	  accepted 3 digits to the left of the decimal, but now it doesn't.
	   My weather station has been misreporting wind direction ever
	  since I did a major overhaul that required re-loading the mysql
	  data from a dump.

	* src/: igate.c, messages.c: Silence some warnings that showed up
	  when building with CLang instead of GCC.

	  One (in igate.c) is just a misuse of "debug_level && 1024"
	  instead of "debug_level & 1024), and the changes in messages.c
	  are all about use of things like:    found =- 1;

	  which it warns as a potential mistake, since it is common to
	  intend this to be:	found -= 1;

	  Making it   found = -1;

	  clarifies the intent for the compiler and stops it from warning.

	* src/wx.c: Fix incorrect test of sscanf return value.	When I

	* src/wx.c: Add a string to the APRS DataLogger debug output.

2012-05-26 19:57  tvrusso

	* src/wx.c: Fix what seems to be a serious error in the Davis APRS
	  DataLogger code.

	  When I first wrote this section I decoded pXXX into "wx_prec_24"
	  and PXXX into "wx_prec_00" since pXXX means "rain in last 24
	  hours" and PXXX means "rain since midnight."	But Xastir actually
	  computes those things itself, and the DAVISMETEO code puts pXXX
	  into "wx_rain_total" instead.

	  AA9VI has been having Issues with his DataLogger, in that Xastir
	  is zeroing out the rainfall improperly.  Turns out that's because
	  I'm never setting wx_rain_total, and Xastir needs that.

	  So I'm removing "rp-" and "rP-" from the debug output, no longer
	  saving PXXX into wx_prec_00 (it's discarded now), and am now
	  saving pXXX into wx_rain_total so that Xastir can handle it
	  properly.

	  This should fix Mike's problem.

2012-05-15 08:29  tvrusso

	* src/map_tif.c: Replace include of "projects.h" with "proj_api.h"
	  and remove use of what is now considered an internal structure
	  (struct PJ).	Replace that usage with a pointer to such a
	  structure (projPJ, which is a typedef to a pointer to a PJ).

	  Proj.4 has removed "projects.h" from the installation of that
	  library, because much that's in it is considered private
	  implementation details that should not have been exposed.  That
	  many packages use those internals directly is considered a
	  problem in those other packages, and a bug request in proj.4's
	  bug tracker to reinstate projects.h as an installed file was
	  closed with the status "wontfix".  Codes that use the public API
	  of proj.4 are supposed to include "proj_api.h" and use the API
	  calls, not direct access to internal data structures or functions
	  that are not intended for use outside the library.

	  Update get-NWSdata to fetch the very latest NWS data.  Some of
	  the files it was trying to get are non longer available.

	  Before committing, I assured that *ALL* files that get-NWSdata
	  downloads have corresponding matching dbfawk files.  Two of the
	  files (oz and w) have had their dbf signatures change, so needed
	  new dbfawk files.  Updated Makefiles to install these new files
	  (which I've named according to a new convention, instead of
	  _ddmmyy_year, I'm using mmyy that matches the dbf file to which
	  it corresponds).

	  Fix a spelling error in testdbfawk ("mathing" instead of
	  "matching").

	  supplied by Arnaud, F4EIR, which simplifies how we do alert->tag
	  processing.  We now grab the alert tag, change it to lower-case,
	  then find a matching file on the filesystem.	If not found, we
	  grab one called "alert.xbm" as a default.  This change will allow
	  adding more files over time for more types (or Country's) alerts.
	  Arnaud has plans to add support for France's weather alerts.

	* README.Getting-Started, README.MAPS, scripts/Makefile.am: Change
	  scripts Makefile.am to remove misuse of "pkglib_SCRIPTS" as this
	  usage was one that was not intended to be correct, but was
	  silently accepted by older versions of automake.  Now automake
	  enforces certain rules about what directory prefixes may be used
	  with what "primaries" (such as _SCRIPTS and _DATA), and "pkglib"
	  is forbidden as a prefix to "_SCRIPTS."

	  This change also changes where scripts are installed.  They used

	* scripts/geopdf2gtiff.pl: Add a "fix neatline" option for GeoPDFs
	  with bad neatlines, such as the most recent US Topo editions,
	  which have neatlines that include all the collar.

	  This hack works when the user specifies --fixneatline or -f, and
	  rounds the left, right, top, and bottom of the image down to the
	  nearest 7.5' quad boundary, and uses those values to construct
	  its own neatline prior to calling gdalwarp with the -cutline
	  -crop_to_cutline options.

2011-09-05 10:29  tvrusso

	* scripts/: Makefile.am, geopdf2gtiff.pl: Added script to convert
	  GeoPDF files to usable GeoTIFF files.

	  This involves extracting the neatline from the GeoPDF, then doing
	  a gdalwarp to strip the collar and warp to EPSG:4326 coordinate
	  system (WGS84 equidistant cylindrical projection), and finally to
	  dither to 8 bit if there is more than one band present.

	  I have found that some GeoPDF files lie about their neatlines,
	  saying the neatline encloses the whole raster including the
	  collar.  There is nothing to be done about this except to
	  hand-craft an FGD file for such GeoPDFs.  With an FGD file,
	  Xastir will collar-strip itself.  This seems only to be a problem
	  with some of the fancier new-style GeoPDF files, the "Digital
	  Maps, Beta."

	  WRT OSM.  His notes: Summary of changes:   - scaling corrected
	  - requested OSM map size limited to 2000x2000 and +/-89 deg
	  latitude   - no 'binned' zoom levels	 - new function key (F4) to
	  'optimize' zoom level for OSM   - .osm maps eliminated   - OSM
	  map files (.geo) built from a single template

	  Details:   scaling corrected:     This required a major rewrite
	  of the map_OSM.c code since	  the map_tiger.c code that it was
	  based on did not support     Mercator projection.

	      Note that due to size limitations from the server and the
	      use of Mercator scaling when the OSM bitmap images are
	  rendered,
	      some OSM maps will not fill the display window. This is
	      particularly common when using a large display window.
	  Selecting
	      an optimized OSM zoom level (F4) will generally, but not
	  always,
	      result in bit map image that fills the window.

	    map size limitations:
	      The OSM map server that is used by this code limits the
	  returned
	      bitmap image to 2000 pixels in either direction. Also, as a
	  side
	      effect of the Mercator projection, latitude values must be
	      limited to -90 < lat < 90.

	    no binned zoom levels:
	      Attempts to constrain the linear Xastir scaling to the binned
	      OSM levels has been unsuccessful. The final straw was a
	  problem
	      with float to integer transitions that would result in
	  looping
	      and oscillation between levels.

	    new function key to optimize OSM zoom levels:
	      Since bitmap images do not scale well, they will always look
	      best when the Xastir scale is closest to the OSM scale. A
	      function key (F4) has been defined that will adjust the
	  Xastir
	      scale to the nearest OSM level and redraw the screen. Note
	  that
	      even if the scale is not changed, the F4 key will redraw the
	      screen- this is intentional on my part.

	      The F4 key works only if an OSM map is selected.

	      If the F4 key is already defined for some other use on your
	      system you can specify an alternative key by modifying the
	  map
	      files (OSM*.geo).  The specified value must be an X11 KeySym
	      value.  Setting the value to 0 will disable the key.

	    .osm maps eliminated
	      Since binned scale levels are no longer supported, the .osm
	      extension is no longer needed. .osm file will not be
	  installed.

	      If your maps directory (typically
	      /usr/local/share/xastir/maps/Online/) contains .osm file from
	  an
	      previous install you will have to remove them by hand.

	      You should also re-index your files
	      (Map->Configure->Index:Reindex ALL maps) to remove them from
	  the
	      Map Chooser.

	    OSM map files (.geo) built from a single template:
	      This is primarily of interest to developers and results in a
	      cleaner source tree.

2010-05-07 09:23  tvrusso

	* src/main.c: Add a very simple hack cribbed from the "Grace"
	  project

	  http://patch-tracker.debian.org/patch/series/view/grace/1:5.1.22-5/motiflockup.diff

	  to work around some extreme breakage introduced by Xorg server
	  around version 1.7.5.  This breakage changed the way the server
	  handles "passive grabs" and has broken *all* motif programs that
	  use XmCreatePopupMenu (among other things); such programs will
	  grab the mouse cursor upon creating the pop-up and restrict
	  cursor motion to within the parent widget of the intended popup,
	  rendering the desktop completely unusable until the X server is
	  killed.  The correct fix is to update Xorg server (the fix is
	  apparently in the yet-to-be-released 1.7.6), but that is not an
	  option for some users of systems that only use stable releases of
	  Xorg, and sometimes not even then (think Ubuntu, where they tend
	  to stick only to bug-fix updates in a given LTS tree, and don't
	  go to the next release number).  Thus, it is necessary either to
	  patch motif libraries or work-around the issue in applications.
	  Since patching motif libraries is not a reasonable thing to
	  require of our users, it's worthwhile to hack Xastir.

	  The work-around ungrabs the mouse cursor immediately after the
	  call to XmCreatePopupMenu.  It's an almost trivial modification
	  of the code.

	  Tested on Xorg-server 1.6.5 and Xorg-server 1.7.5.  Looks good,
	  so committing it.

	  The fix does have one unfortunate side effect on the newer server
	  , as it is somewhat more difficult to tap the right mouse button
	  and get the right-click menu to stay up, but it is possible.	On
	  the older server it appears to have no effect at all, which is
	  good.

	* src/: db.c, db_gis.c, db_gis.h, interface.c, interface_gui.c,
	  main.c: Mike, W2SWR, attempted to deploy Xastir over a MySQL
	  database, and in the process helped to find multiple issues,
	  including both an inability to compile xastir with just
	  --with-mysql, and multiple causes for segfaults starting and
	  stopping database interfaces and saving data.  This commit
	  addresses these issues.

	  Xastir now compiles and runs with either or both --with-mysql and
	  --with-postgis, as reqired definitions for each have now been
	  appropriately included with preprocessor directives.

	  The key fix for stability is in db_gis.h, the connection array
	  has been redefined  from an array pointer to an array, and the
	  MYSQL object in the Connection struct has been changed from a
	  MYSQL pointer to a MYSQL.  Calls to methods that pass database
	  connections have been rewritten to pass the address of the
	  connection (&aDbConnection), rather than the connection.

	  Multiple other fixes, mostly involving correcting the use of
	  pointers, have been made to the db_gis.c code, and these have
	  been tested and found to work with storage and retrieval of large
	  quantities of internet feed data (on the order of 800,000
	  records) to both MySQL and Postgis databases, with xastir
	  compiled with --with-mysql, --with-postgis separately, and with
	  --with-mysql --with-postgis together.

	  Also fixed a user interface bug that prevented retention of a
	  selection of mysql(spatial) as a database type.

	* src/main.c: Fix three instances of a string compare being
	  attempted by:    char chararray[EXTENT]    read chararray from
	  some file    if (chararray == "string literal")    {	  }

	  which is bad form in C and could lead to undefined behavior.	The
	  correct way to do this is with strcmp or strncmp.  I replaced
	  this with:

	     if (strncmp(chararray,"string literal",strlen(chararray))==0)
	     {
	     }

	  This is silently accepted by most older compilers, but is warned

	* src/: db.c, objects.c:
	  Fix two bugs.

	  1) Bug 1698474 in the sourceforge tracker (Expire code messes up
	  internal linked-list order)

	     The title of the bug is erroneous.  The expire code doesn't
	  mess up
	     any internal linked-list order.  The expire code was being
	  messed
	     up by a broken linked-list order.	What was breaking the list
	  was
	     the handling of our own objects.  Code throughout objects.c
	  was
	     continually resetting the time stamp of station records to
	     sec_now() withouth then moving the station record to the end
	  of the
	     time-sorted list.	This led to the time-sorted list not being
	     time-sorted anymore.  The expire code explicitly depends on
	  the
	     list remaining sorted at all times.

	     There was also a small block of code dating back to version
	  1.1 of
	     db.c that also skipped moving a station record in the
	  time-sorted
	     list if it was our object or item.  This very old code appears
	  to
	     do nothing at all.  I have removed it.  The time sorted list
	  MUST
	     be kept in time-sorted order.  There was also a variable
	     (object_is_mine_previous) that was set by this block of code
	  but never
	     accessed anywhere else.  I've removed that variable, too.

	     Additionally, the check_station_remove function erroneously
	  checks
	     "is_my_station" to determine if the station or object in
	  question is
	     owned by "me."  It should be checking (is_my_station ||
	  is_my_object_item)
	     to be consistent with the older conditional that is commented
	  out just
	     above it.

	  2) Creating an object that has the same name as a previously
	  killed object    would lead to an "immovable" object being
	  created.  This bug was never	  entered into the issue tracker.

	     Prior to this commit, the following actions would create an
	  object that
	     could not be moved:

		 create object a
		 delete object a
		 create object a

	     Once the second create was done, the object a could not be
	  moved by any
	     means on the screen -- either by dragging with the Move button
	  down or
	     using the Modify Object dialog.

	     The reason was that the code to handle resurrecting a killed
	  object
	     was improperly flagging the new object as being "my station"
	  in
	     addition to being flagged as "my object."	The code that
	  decodes
	     position strings would see this flag and refuse to move the
	  object
	     "because I know my position better."  Furthermore, the
	  resurrection
	     code would remove the old killed record from the name-sorted
	  list,
	     but not really delete the station record, leaving it in the
	     time-sorted list.	This also impacted expiration.	This commit
	     fixes the improper flagging as "my station" and completely
	  deletes
	     the station record for a killed object when we create a new
	  object
	     with the same name.

2009-12-04 10:54  tvrusso

	* src/: map_WMS.c, map_geo.c, map_tiger.c:
	  Fix for the problem where Xastir will display black images when
	  compiled against GraphicsMagick with its new default QuantumDepth
	  of 8, or ImageMagick with its optional QuantumDepth of 8.

	  The problem was that when the image was not a colormapped image
	  (e.g. JPEG or other full color type), Xastir was assuming
	  (incorrectly) that a Quantum was the same type as the red, green,
	  and blue components of an XColor, and using the Quantums directly
	  out of the pixel_pack in a call that required the latter.  The
	  result was that when pack_pixel_bits returned, the result was
	  always that the packed pixel bits were always 0x000000, because
	  it was taking the high-order 8 bits from the unsigned short to
	  which the unsigned char was being cast.

	  What was needed was a little block of code that massaged the
	  pixel_pack values into unsigned shorts at that point if
	  QuantumDepth is 8.

	  This fix applies the same fix to map_tiger, map_geo and map_WMS,
	  all of which had duplicated code (ugh) that made the same
	  mistaken assumption of Quantum/unsigned short equivalence.

	  This fix does NOT address the problem that exists on a few
	  systems, where ImageMagick has been compiled with HDRI (High
	  Dynamic Range Image) support.  On those systems, a Quantum is not
	  even an integer type, it's a float or double.  Dealing with
	  *that* mess will be harder.

	  Ideally, the duplicated code between map_WMS, map_geo, and
	  map_tiger should be consolidated according to good software
	  engineering principles.

2009-11-26 08:52  tvrusso

	* LaCrosse/src/open2300db2APRS.c:
	  Fix for an insidious bug in open2300db2APRS that relied on an
	  unsafe internal behavior of the mysql API.

	  The function Get_Latest_WX makes 2 SQL queries to the server, one
	  to get the highest value of the "timestamp" field present in the
	  DB, an another to get the row with that timestamp.  Only after
	  the first query was the function calling "row =
	  mysql_fetch_row(&result)".  That function returns a char ** that
	  can be used to pick off the field values.  Somehow, despite never
	  being called after the second query, the row array still managed
	  (on some systems) to have the right data in it --- presumably
	  because the API call was returning a pointer to an internal block
	  of memory that contained the field values, and on the systems
	  where this worked that block wasn't moving.

	  When I upgraded my BSD system and recompiled mysql, this started
	  failing, and open2300db2APRS would segfault.

	  Calling mysql_fetch_row after the second query fixes it.

	  While I was at it, I fixed a mistake in some debug output that
	  prints the number of fields retrieved by the query.

	  Fix an annoyance related to DF bearing reports.

	  Sometimes a bad parse of garbled Mic-E data causes Xastir to
	  think that a D700 (or other mobile) is sending a DF report.  Even
	  if only a single such garbled transmission is received, the
	  station is shown with DF bearing information for as long as it's
	  in the database.  Watching a mobile drive around with randomly
	  moving DF beam lines is distracting.	Not being able to make it
	  go away without restarting Xastir has been annoying.

	  Another way for this to happen is for some bonehead (such as
	  KM5VY) to create a series of DF objects from an external program
	  with his callsign as base name and sequential numbers to identify
	  the reports (say "KM5VY-1", "KM5VY-2", etc.) until he happens to
	  hit the SSID of the station that's sending the reports (say,
	  KM5VY-8).  What happens is the "object" data gets attached to the
	  Xastir instance itself.  This bogus beam heading shows up forever
	  until shutting down Xastir.  This happened today on a SAR ELT DF
	  practice.  The name of the bonehead has not been changed to
	  protect the bonehead.

	  This commit adds the ability to clear such bogosity.	Now, the
	  "Station Info" dialog for any station with DF bearing information
	  has a "Clear DF Bearing" button that will zero out the bearing
	  and NRQ strings for the station, removing the unwanted (and
	  presumably incorrect) bearing lines until the station transmits
	  them again (which probably means they're wanted and not
	  incorrect).

	  Add a map-decluttering option.

	  Prior to this commit, "Station->Filter Display->Display DF
	  Attributes" would draw a pair of bearing lines for every DF
	  object.  The lines drawn represented the stated beamwidth of the
	  report.

	  Unfortunately, in a big DFing operation, this rapidly leads to a
	  huge clutter on the map, making it very difficult, if not
	  impossible,  to read.  I saw this during a big DF practice this
	  morning, and just had to change it.

	  I have added two new buttons under Display DF Attributes:
	  "Display DF Beamwidth" and "Display DF Bearing."  Selecting the
	  first and not the second gives the current behavior.	Selecting
	  the second and not the first draws only the stated bearing, not
	  the beamwidth.  Selecting both draws all three lines for those
	  who really, really like cluttered maps.  The color of red used
	  for the bearing line and the beamwidth lines is slightly
	  different.

	  I tried to set up xa_config so that when people first start up
	  Xastir after updating, they'll recover the original behavior ---
	  "Display DF Bearing" defaults to off if it's not found in the
	  config file.	Unless the new option is deliberately selected,
	  users should not notice the change.

	  Both Display DF Bearing and Display DF Beamwidth are greyed out
	  if "Display DF Attributes" is deselected.

	  Updated all the language files with the "update-language.pl"
	  script to support the new menu items.  A lot of other things got
	  changed in the language files with this action, but those seemed
	  mostly to be comments.

	  A note from Craig about layering:

	    "...use "vi" on the map_index.sys file while xastir is not
	  running.
	    Once you are editing the file, use the following 3 commands in
	  "vi"
	    to change the layers.  This assumes that, like with my xastir,
	  new
	    maps get added into the list at layer 1000.

	    :g/tabblock/s/01000/00995/
	    :g/pointlm/s/01000/00996/
	    :g/arealm/s/01000/00997/

	    (translation: global search throughout the file for lines with
	    "arealm" and substitute on that line for "01000", a "00997")

	    This moves the tabblock (& tabblock00) files, pointlm files,
	  and
	    arealm files down underneath the roads maps.  Otherwise the
	  roads
	    can get covered up by urban background coloring.  Or you can do
	  this
	    through the GUI interface as well."

	  Neither is strictly correct since perl could be installed just

	  the rest of the scripts here.

	  Ideally the location of the perl interpreter should be probed by
	  configure and substituted in all the scripts, but that is
	  probably more work than it's worth given that all of our scripts
	  have had /usr/bin/perl hardcoded all this time.

	  #!/usr/bin/env perl

	  is sometimes suggested to make such scripts system-independent,
	  but this is generally considered a security vulnerability because
	  it uses the first "perl" that appears in the user's path, which
	  might be a malicious bit of code.

2008-12-31 20:37  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Changing xastir.cnf -> xastir.cnf.1 to a
	  copy_file() call instead of a move().  This assures that we'll
	  always have a config file in place even if we error-out before we
	  can complete the next block which renames xastir.cnf.tmp ->
	  xastir.cnf.

2008-12-31 20:18  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: A better ordering for writing the config file.
	  We now write a temporary file.  If successful, we rename all the
	  backups and then rename the temporary file as the current config
	  file.  This should help to minimize the instances of config file
	  corruption.

2008-12-09 08:10  we7u

	* FAQ, README, README.Contributing, README.Getting-Started,
	  README.win32: Adding notes about having to subscribe to the

2008-11-24 12:27  we7u

2008-11-12 15:26  tvrusso

	* src/map_geo.c: Comment out the use of GetOnePixel and the
	  variable it assigns to.

	  This is for two reasons:

	   1) F*!#*ng ImageMagick has broken its API yet again with version
	  6.4.5,
	      making GetOnePixel no longer compatible with usage prior to
	  6.4.4
	   2) map_geo.c does this:
		PixelPacket target;
		target=GetOnePixel(image,0,0)
	      after which it does NOTHING with the pixel so retrieved.	So
	  commenting
	      out this useless line is less work than what I had started
	  doing,
	      which was hacking the configure detection of ImageMagick to
	  distinguish
	      between pre-6.4.5 and post-6.4.5, and coding around this
	  garbage.

	  I Hate ImageMagick.

2008-10-17 00:18  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.aea: Turning on the HID function which is

2008-10-08 21:57  we7u

2008-10-08 21:56  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing a debug format so that it doesn't cause a
	  warning on 64-bit machines.

2008-10-08 08:11  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Getting rid of two compiler warnings:  One by forcing
	  a terminator into the first char of a string buffer instead of
	  doing an empty xastir_snprintf(), another by casting a strlen()
	  result to an int for an fprintf.

2008-10-07 23:10  we7u

	* src/shp_hash.c: Reverting back to the original code for strncpy()
	  in this module:  The previous change caused a panic.

2008-10-07 22:59  we7u

	* src/shp_hash.c: Getting rid of another strncpy() call.

2008-10-07 22:42  we7u

2008-10-06 22:04  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing the my_text string buffer in TrackMouse() so
	  that it won't get overrun.  The worst conditions are English
	  Units, Dist/Bearing Status enabled, Degrees/Minutes/Seconds,
	  zoomed out to world view and putting the mouse in the "corner" of
	  the world (10,000+ miles).  This results in about 54 characters
	  being used whereas the original string buffer was only capable of
	  holding 49.

2008-09-26 07:30  gstueve

2008-09-24 11:03  gstueve

	* src/map_tiger.c: Found one more place that needed to release
	  ExceptionInfo when interrupted.

2008-09-24 09:16  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS, scripts/LSB-BUILD, src/Makefile.am, src/testawk.c,
	  src/testdbfawk.c: Rename "testawk" to "testdbfawk" and add it to
	  the list of programs that "make install" will install.

	  This addresses a couple of issues:   0) Testawk is a *terrible*
	  name for this program, because in fact it does      not test
	  "awk", the system program, but rather "dbfawk," the Xastir
	  feature inspired by awk but completely unrelated to awk in any
	  other sense.	  1) testawk was never installed by Xastir's build
	  process, meaning that       packagers of Xastir binaries for
	  various systems did not bundle this	    little program with
	  their binary packages.  There is even a bug in       debian's bug
	  tracker from an Xastir user asking that the xastir package
	  have testawk installed (in a non-standard place because of its
	     "generic, even misleading name") by the .deb package.

	  I've updated README.MAPS and the LSB-BUILD script to make them
	  refer to testdbfawk instead of testawk.  I'll still have to
	  change various web resources so they point at the new program,
	  too.

2008-09-22 13:19  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Removing an earlier change 'cuz it makes the
	  server ports die when a client disconnects.  Without this line
	  they appear to be solid again.

2008-09-11 06:07  we7u

	* src/main.c: Grey'ing out the xfontsel buttons when that app's not
	  available.

2008-09-09 22:38  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Saving/restoring the tracking station callsign
	  to/from the config file, but not saving the state of the tracking
	  toggle.  This means that the last tracked callsign will be
	  remembered but tracking will not be on when Xastir starts up.

2008-09-09 22:17  we7u

	* src/db.c: A proper label for the new "Track Station" button on
	  the Station Info dialog.

2008-09-09 22:11  we7u

	* src/db.c: Initial working version of "Track Station" from the
	  Station Info dialog.	Still needs additions to the language files
	  for the button label.

2008-09-09 20:10  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Adding some comments near four areas that cause
	  compiler warnings which we can currently do nothing about.

2008-09-09 20:09  we7u

	* src/testawk.c: Changing an int* to an int to get rid of a

2008-09-09 20:07  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Adding /opt/local/ directory to the test for

	  to help find GM before IM on FreeBSD systems.

2008-09-09 08:47  we7u

	* src/util.c: Changing the return type for a curl function to get
	  rid of a warning caused by newer versions of libcurl.

2008-09-09 08:37  we7u

	* src/: main.c, track_gui.c: Adding #ifdef's around SED and MV
	  calls.

2008-09-09 08:20  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added #ifdef around XFONTSEL call so that absence of

2008-08-27 06:25  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Introduce proper quoting of AC_CACHE_CHECK
	  arguments in XASTIR_GUESS_RUNPATH_SWITCH macro.

2008-08-27 06:23  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Fix the XASTIR_GUESS_RUNPATH_SWITCH macro so that
	  it uses AC_CACHE_CHECK with a CACHE-ID that conforms to the
	  naming conventions expected.

	  In versions of autoconf 2.62 and later, using a CACHE-ID without
	  the "_cv_" string included in its name produces an annoying and
	  possibly confusing warning message:

	   configure.ac:572: warning: AC_CACHE_VAL(xastir_runpath_switch,
	  ...): suspicious cache-id, must contain _cv_ to be cached
	   ../../lib/autoconf/general.m4:1973: AC_CACHE_VAL is expanded
	  from...
	   ../../lib/autoconf/general.m4:1993: AC_CACHE_CHECK is expanded
	  from...
	   acinclude.m4:1131: XASTIR_GUESS_RUNPATH_SWITCH is expanded
	  from...
	   acinclude.m4:1120: XASTIR_ADD_LIBPATH_TO is expanded from...

	   ../../lib/autoconf/general.m4:2469: AC_TRY_COMPILE is expanded
	  from...
	   acinclude.m4:1059: XASTIR_BERKELEY_DB_CHK is expanded from...
	   configure.ac:572: the top level

	  several times during bootstrap.  By renaming
	  "xastir_runpath_switch" to "xastir_cv_runpath_switch" throughout
	  acinclude.m4, this warning is silenced and the variable is cached
	  as intended.

	  According to the autoconf documentation, cache variables *MUST*
	  have the "_cv_" string in their names.  It is only in recent
	  versions of autoconf that violating this requirement is actually
	  flagged as a warning.

	* configure.ac, scripts/BUILDRPMS, scripts/LSB-BUILD,

2008-08-15 12:41  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, util.c: More Tactical Call changes:

	  Max tactical call length is now 57.

2008-07-28 02:10  we7u

	* src/db.c: Cleaning up the input parameters for one of the new
	  tactical call helper routines.  Leading/trailing spaces on
	  callsign or tac-callsign affect the results little now.
	  Lower-case callsigns are converted to upper case now.  One minor
	  annoyance:  Blanking out callsigns using messages to TACTICAL
	  results in this being displayed in the station chooser when there
	  are more than one station under the mouse:  "()".  The proper
	  display should be the callsign in that case, so perhaps spaces
	  are still getting saved in the tactical callsign slot -or- the
	  tactical callsign string isn't getting free'd and the pointer
	  NULLed out (the latter is most likely).

2008-07-28 01:37  we7u

	* src/: db.c, util.c, util.h: The beginnings of being able to share
	  Tactical Call data with others over the air.	This code works,
	  decoding messages sent to "TACTICAL" which are in one of these
	  four formats:     My Home	WE7U-3=My Home	   WE7U-3=My
	  Home;WE7U-12=Curt's Jeep;WE7U-15=I Don't Know
	  WE7U-3=;WE7U-12=;WE7U-15= In the first case it'll assign "My
	  Home" as the tactical callsign for the station that sent the
	  message.  In the last case it'll remove tactical callsigns for
	  the listed stations.	For testing remember that you can't send a
	  new message to TACTICAL until the previous message has either
	  timed-out or been cancelled.

	* src/maps.c: Fix map metadata for upper left corner.

	  Previously, the code was using the same coordinate pair to
	  compute the upper left and lower right corner strings.  For some
	  reason, this ultimately made somewhat correct labels for UTM, but
	  completely wrong labels for Lat/Lon.

	  Since this simple change makes the code produce correct labels
	  for all coordinate systems, and the other shouldn't have worked
	  for any, I feel safe committing it.  But I would have liked to
	  understand why it worked at all for UTM.

	* src/db.c: Decode DAO patch by Tapio Sokura, OH2KKU.  This doesn't
	  do anything with any datum transmitted, but does give us the

	* acinclude.m4: Change "AC_CHECK_LIB" to "AC_SEARCH_LIBS" for
	  ImageMagick.

	  A recent update to ImageMagick stuffs the "WriteImage" function
	  into libMagickCore instead of libMagick, and the older probe was
	  missing it.

	  With this change, I see that WriteImage gets found without adding
	  anything to LIBS, because "Magick-config" already stuffed the
	  right thing into LIBS.

2008-03-20 21:00  chicoreus

	* src/: db.c, db_gis.c, db_gis.h, interface.c, interface_gui.c,
	  main.c: Identified and fixed problem underlying stability of
	  multiple database connections (space for connection structures
	  was incorrectly allocated so that writing an error message into
	  one connection overwrote memory used by another connection).
	  Fixed additional problems related to connection failures and
	  added more resilience to database connection problems.

2008-03-18 19:10  chicoreus

	* src/: db.c, db_gis.c, db_gis.h, interface.c, interface_gui.c,
	  main.c, main.h: Overhaul of the way sql database connections are
	  handled, reducing the complexity by eliminating the
	  ConnectionList struct, and creating an array of Connections, one
	  for each interface.  More than one database connection can now be
	  run at once, though there is still an issue with pointers or
	  memory handling somewhere and instabilites can be produced by
	  stopping and starting database connections.

	  Moved all the db_gis related debug_level tests from 1 to 4096.

2008-03-11 20:27  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Fix a fairly dumb thing in the probe for Berkeley
	  DB --- it was always resetting the result (BDB_LIB_FOUND) to
	  "-ldb" even if the actual library found was something else.  This
	  variable was used only to report to the user what library was
	  found, never as the actual "-l" flag.  This could have led to
	  confusion, but not improper operation.

2008-02-29 08:54  chicoreus

	* src/: database.h, db.c, db_gis.c, interface_gui.c: Added trails
	  to db_gis code. Multiple points from one station retrieved from a
	  database query are added as trailpoints.  Existing stations heard
	  from other sources and retrieved from a database query aren't
	  duplicated as DataRows, but have appropriate trail points added
	  (if the existing position is older than the database data, the
	  existing position becomes as trailpoint; if the database data is
	  older, it gets added as trailpoints).

	  Added timeformat to add_simple_station, as Postgresql and MySQL
	  timestamps don't both include the local timezone "%z" in the
	  current simple station query formats.

	  Added APRS_WXn character constants as a workaround, since
	  AprsTypes and Record Type character constants are used
	  inconsistently in DataRow.record_type, and AprsTypes without
	  character constants don't write cleanly into MySQL or Postgresql
	  database records.

	  Added and commented out lines to start database connections from
	  interfaces Left commented out as multiple open database
	  connections are still unstable and segfault.

2008-02-27 20:02  gstueve

	* scripts/fcc-get: FCC moved the database again. Look for it in new
	  place.

2008-02-21 20:57  chicoreus

	* src/: database.h, db.c, db_gis.c, interface.c: Improvements to
	  the tollerance of the db_gis code to problems with connections to
	  databases and improved reporting of problems in making
	  connections.

	  Added code to add tracks for stations retrieved from the
	  database.  Still needs work, as the existing db.c code for adding
	  stations and points to the tracks of stations makes different
	  assumptions about the order in which positions are recieved than
	  the order of records queried in db_gis.c.

2008-02-21 20:51  chicoreus

	* scripts/: db_gis_mysql.sql, db_gis_postgis.sql: Adding some
	  indexes to speed up retrieval of station records.  Adding a view
	  that could be used with mapserver to return icon files for each
	  station.

2008-02-16 08:15  we7u

	* src/main.c: Switching the Garmin RINO processing to use

	  additional copyright information.

2008-02-07 18:47  chicoreus

	* src/: main.c, main.h, maps.c, maps.h, xa_config.c: Adding two new
	  KML export features:

	  1) KML Snapshots - on a regular basis (using the same timing as
	  PNG snapshots), write all currently known stations to a kml file.

	  2) KML file to accompany PNG snapshots.  After converting
	  snapshot.png to snapshot.jpg, the accompanying snapshot.kml file
	  can be used to layer the snapshot.jpg image on the landscape in a
	  kml application.

	  The KML produced is valid and appears to work, but hasn't been
	  extensively tested.

	  This (along with the allready committed export a single station
	  track to kml feeature) should complete the feature request for
	  KML export:
	  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1863377&group_id=45562&atid=443274

	  analogus to png snapshots.

2008-02-07 18:29  chicoreus

	* scripts/: kml_snapshot_feed.kml, kml_snapshot_to_web.sh: An
	  example kml file and a shell script to allow png snapshots with
	  their accompanying snapshot.kml file to be used as a regularly
	  updated kml feed on a webserver (allowing the current snapshot
	  from xastir to be draped over the landscape in a kml application
	  remotely subscribing to the feed.)

2008-01-29 19:08  chicoreus

	* help/help-English.dat: Correcting a spelling error (found by

	  Placing more references to button titles in quotes to make the

	  Clarifying (hopefully) some of the description of saving tracks
	  from the station info dialog.

2008-01-25 21:45  chicoreus

	* src/: db.c, util.c, util.h: Added a utility function to return a
	  date/time in w3c timestamp format, required for valid timestamps
	  in kml files.

	  Rearranged the log station to kml code, and added timestamped
	  placemarks for each location of a station in a track.  This
	  produces kml output that validates, and should behave like the
	  "Shroeder" whale shark example file (moving a station location
	  along its track as a time slider control is moved in Google
	  Earth).  This has not yet been tested to see if the behavior is
	  as desired.

2008-01-24 14:36  chicoreus

	* src/: interface_gui.c, main.c, objects.c: Fix for bug 1863228.
	  Lesstif doesn't yet fully support combo boxes, which are used in
	  4 places in Xastir (for user configurable predefined objects file
	  in defaults dialog, cad object line type in the cad object
	  details dialog, and twice in the interface properties dialog when
	  defining a sql database interface.

	  An alternate lesstif menu that mimics a combo box control
	  (modified from xpdf's XPDFViewer.cc), is applied in three of
	  these four cases (the fourth currently only has a single option,
	  and might not be the best control for the situation, picking
	  database schema type[s]).

	  This has been tested on lesstif 0.94.4 and openmotif 2.3.0.

2008-01-23 00:23  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added "volatile" keyword to a couple of

2008-01-17 19:21  chicoreus

	* src/: db.c, db_gis.c, main.c: Minor stability improvements to
	  db_gis code.	Adding some sanity checks for null database
	  connections when running queries to reduce segfaults.

	  Begining cleanup of the db_gis code.	Removing some leftover
	  unused variables and code.  Explicit type casting of some
	  pointers in function calls to suppress compiler warnings.

2008-01-16 20:33  chicoreus

	* src/: database.h, db.c, db_gis.c, main.c, objects.c: First pass

	  track on the station information dialog, both an xastir format
	  file and a kml file for the selected station will be written to
	  ~/.xastir/tracklogs

	  Added more comments on how database schema version and series
	  compatability should work.

	  Fixed (superficially) a bug where station data would be written
	  to a non-open database connection causing a segfault.  Connection
	  handling in db_gis is fragile and needs review.

	  Stations heard in Xastir can have the core station information
	  logged to either a Postgres or MySQL database (Bug: currently

	  subsequent Xastir session (or by a different Xastir instance, or
	  by another GIS application (such as QGIS over a postgis database
	  populated from Xastir)).

	  Tested with MySQL 5.0.32, may not work with MySQL 4.1.  Tested
	  with Postgres 8.1.9

	* configure.ac: Fix improper probing of curl library when LSB is
	  not being used.

	  AC_CHECK_LIB can have two or three arguments.  With two arguments
	  it tests for the presence of a function named in the second
	  argument in the library named by the first argument, and if found
	  defines HAVE_LIBxxxxx and adds -lxxxxx to LIBS.

	  In the three-argument case, it does the probe the same way, but
	  instead of the default "define HAVE_LIBxxxxx and add -lxxxxx to
	  LIBS" it does what it's told in the third argument.  That means
	  if you want to rely on HAVE_LIBxxxxx and LIBS="${LIBS} -lxxxxx"
	  then you have to do it yourself in the third argument.

	  The AC_CHECK_LIB for curl was only doing the extra thing, which
	  was to set "use_curl" to "yes".

	  I recently discovered this by trying to build and use xastir on a
	  freshly installed system that had libcurl but no wget (most of my
	  other systems have both).  The bug in the use of AC_CHECK_LIB
	  meant that libcurl was found, but never linked in nor was
	  HAVE_LIBCURL ever set in config.h.

	  With this fix, curl is now both properly detected *and* the
	  detection properly communicated to the code.

2007-12-13 22:23  tvrusso

	* config/tgr2shp.dbfawk: Add "P" feature class to handle
	  "Provisional" road data in TIGER/Line shapefiles.  According to
	  the TIGER/Line Technical Documentation for feature class "P"

	     The U.S. Census Bureau has created a new CFCC type that may
	  appear on
	     street features only.  Some streets that normally would be
	  classified as
	     "A" class features may be coded with a "P" instead of the "A"
	  to indicate
	     that the feature is a a "provisional" feature.  Provisional
	  features are
	     those streets that were added from reference sources or other
	  programs
	     in preparation for Census 2000, but were not field verified by
	  census staff
	     during field operations or through the use of aerial
	  photography or imagery.
	     As these featues are verified in futuer operations the
	  provisional flag
	     will be removed for subsequent TIGER/Line releases.  The
	  numeric portion
	     of the CFCC still classifies the street as if an "A" were
	  preceding it.

	  So this just involves changing the matching pattern from
	  CFCC=A... to CFCC=[AP]... in all the feature-class A rules.

2007-12-05 08:40  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS: Add more text to the section on Geocommuity's DRG
	  Data Bundle deals.  Turns out that some areas have DRGs produced
	  by some agency other than the USGS, and those agencies don't
	  necessarily produce GeoTiff files with proper metadata.  The
	  Tennesee Valley Authority is among those agencies that don't
	  properly include GeoTiff tags for projection and datum.  This
	  renders DRG data bundles for states with portions of their area
	  covered by the TVA partially defective --- special preprocessing
	  is necessary to get the files into a state that can be used in
	  Xastir.

2007-11-14 07:05  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS: Add a pointer to a vendor of inexpensive GeoTIFF
	  format DRGs for the US.  They're one of the USGS's data partners

	  Thanks to Eric, KZ5ED, for calling it to my attention.

	* src/: main.c, map_WMS.c, map_geo.c, map_tiger.c, maps.c: Work
	  around the fact that ImageMagick's api.h rudely includes their
	  autoconf-generated config.h, which therefore defines the same
	  PACKAGE and VERSION macros that we do.

	  In most files, this produces an annoying but harmless warning
	  message about a redefinition.  For main.c, however, it cause
	  Magick's PACKAGE name and VERSION to be used in place of our own.
	   That is, our About window will announce that we're ImageMagick
	  version 6.3.x.

	  For the files in which it's a harmless warning, I've done an
	  #undef of the two macros to shut up the compiler warnings.

	  In main.c, I've created two new char* variables and initialized
	  them to PACKAGE and VERSION before including magick's api.h, and
	  then undef'd them.  This preservs the contents of our macros by
	  substituting them in C code right away, then gets rid of them so
	  the warnings are shut up.

	  Attempting to do:   #define XASTIR_PACKAGE PACKAGE   #undef
	  PACKAGE   #include <magick/api.h>   #undef PACKAGE   #define
	  PACKAGE XASTIR_PACKAGE

	  doesn't help.  All that does is silence the warning.	Magick's
	  package name is still used when we try to use the PACKAGE macro
	  later.  Macro expansions aren't variable assignments, and the
	  code above does nothing more than define PACKAGE to PACKAGE and
	  thence to "ImageMagick", after briefly allowing api.h to change
	  its meaning without warning.

	  Adding an "#undef XASTIR_PACKAGE" after all that is even worse,
	  and results in fatal compilation errors.  There's probably some
	  preprocessor game that can be played to kludge this, but saving
	  the string we want to keep somewhere where it's safe from
	  preprocessor meddling seems the better choice.

	* src/db.c, src/db_gis.c, src/db_gis.h, src/interface.c,
	  src/interface_gui.c, src/main.c, symbols/symbols.dat: Cleaning up
	  db_gis code.

	  Some cleanup of error messages.  Moved some debugging messages
	  into debug_level & 1.

	  Altered simpleStation table structure to add three more columns:

	  alter table simpleStation add column origin varchar(9) not null
	  default ''; alter table simpleStation add column record_type
	  varchar(1); alter table simpleStation add column node_path
	  varchar(56);

	  These seem necessary for recreating DataRow records out of
	  simpleStation database records.

	  Added more testing and handling of data that is to be written to
	  database records.  Still needs better sanitizing.  Tested saving
	  DataRow records derived from internet feeds to MySQL (old), and
	  Postgresql(8)/Postgis records.

2007-07-02 16:43  tvrusso

	* configure.ac: Remove hack to use external rtree library ---
	  differences between GRASS's rtree library and ours make it so
	  that we can't use them interchangably.  The difference is in the
	  size of floating point variables used in the Rect structure (we
	  use floats as did the original author, GRASS uses it modified to
	  have doubles, which vastly increases memory usage for no real
	  gain).

	  This should remedy all of the Fedora users problems.	Unless it
	  doesn't.

2007-07-02 16:37  tvrusso

	  on all symbols in the rtree library was very simple and fast, so
	  I Just Did It.

	  This should probably fix the problem for Fedora users with GDAL

	  from configure.ac.

2007-07-02 05:55  tvrusso

	* src/rtree/: split_l.c, split_l.h: Undo the
	  CoverSplit->l_CoverSplit change made last week.

	  The real issue was that some repositories have a GDAL that
	  includes GRASS libraries including a libgrass_rtree that
	  duplicates the rtree functionality.  Xastir's rtree library is
	  precisely the one that GRASS uses (based on public domain (i.e.
	  uncopyrighted) software from www.superliminal.com), and this
	  leads to a link conflict that produces an obscure and cryptic
	  error message at link time.

	  Renaming the CoverSplit variable was just a band-aid that was
	  suggested for a trial run while diagnosing the problem, not a
	  recommended fix.

2007-07-01 21:20  tvrusso

	* configure.ac: Add a note at the end that tells whether we're
	  using external rtree (e.g.  from GDAL) or our own internal
	  version.

2007-07-01 21:12  tvrusso

	* configure.ac: Fix configure so that it checks for the presence of
	  RTreeSearch in other libraries before it builds our own rtree
	  library.

	  This is necessary because some repositories have a GDAL that was
	  built with GRASS support (against current recommendations), and
	  that brings in an rtree library unbidden.  The result of trying
	  to link our own in unconditionally is a cryptic message about
	  CoverSplit not being relocatable.

	  The only testing I've done is that this doesn't break builds with
	  GDAL that has no GRASS support.  I am unable to test it in the
	  case for which it is intended.  I'll have to ask that someone
	  with an F7 system do that.

	* src/util.c: Fix a comment about multiline length.

2007-05-28 12:51  tvrusso

	* src/: db.c, util.c, util.h:
	  Make the add_comment function stop stripping leading spaces.
	  This is to allow multiline objects with no leading text, which
	  otherwise get broken.

	  Add a makeMultiline function to util.c.  Given arrays of lat/lon
	  pairs, will produce a multiline string representing that array
	  and a centroid value that can be used for creating an object.

	  Bunch of debugging output added to extract_multipoint that I
	  needed to help me track down why my multilines were disappearing
	  (it was because of the leading space stripping).

	  Nobody is calling makeMultiline yet.	It could be used for
	  transmitting CAD objects if someone wanted to hack that in.

	  I've tested makeMultiline in an external program to generate
	  strings, then created objects by pasting the strings into the
	  comment box of the create object dialog.

2007-05-21 07:51  tvrusso

2007-05-09 10:36  tvrusso

	  Preparing for stable 1.9.0 release.

2007-04-27 09:55  tvrusso

	* src/db.c: Cast the time_t value to (long int) before passing to
	  fprintf.  On some systems (e.g. FreeBSD) time_t isn't a long, and
	  using a %ld format for it generates a warning.  On other systems,
	  time_t *is* a long int and using a %d format generates a warning.

	  So punt: cast to (long int) and use %ld.  This should make all
	  those systems shut up with their warnings.

2007-04-27 06:52  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing some debug printf's from %d to %ld for

2007-04-16 11:17  tvrusso

	  #1698474

	  Add a "dump_time_sorted_list" method and calls to it so we can

	  check fails.

	  Also reduce the debugging expire time from 1 hour to 5 minutes.

	* config/language-German.sys: Updates by Rolf Bleher, DK7IN.
	  Thanks!

2007-03-31 12:49  tvrusso

	* src/: database.h, db.c: Add some sanity checking to the
	  EXPIRE_DEBUG logic.

	  I am still seeing that every few weeks my xastir run starts to
	  have stations that should have expired 10 days ago, but still has
	  'em.	This really screws up the ALOHA calculations.

	  This sanity checking just goes through the entire time-sorted
	  list and checks to see if any stations are older than the expire
	  time, and does this immediately after the expiration is
	  processed.  The sanity checking only happens when EXPIRE_DEBUG is
	  defined.

	  The expire code assumes that the list is sorted by time, and
	  stops when it finds a station newer than the expire time.  If the
	  list is somehow getting corrupted and no longer properly sorted,
	  that would explain the behavior I'm seeing.  I still haven't
	  found the problem, but this should at least tell me if the list
	  management has a bug or not.

2007-03-07 21:17  tvrusso

	* src/: database.h, db.c: Change "check_station_remove" and
	  "check_message_remove" to take a time_t for curr_time instead of
	  an int.  time_t's are what's passed in, so let's keep it
	  consistent.

	  I do not believe this has anything at all to do with the fact
	  that my xastir instance isn't deleting stations on the 1-day
	  cycle I ask it to --- on my system a time_t and an int are the
	  same size, and time_t is defined as an int32, not an unsigned or
	  anything.  But it's still the right thing to do.

2007-03-06 13:58  we7u

2007-01-27 10:41  tvrusso

	* configure.ac: re-enable check for the X Printing Extension
	  library.  Apparently this is needed by libXm and some systems do
	  not properly bring in the indirect dependence through the dynamic
	  loader.

	  It would probably be better to detect that condition than just
	  blindly checking for Xp (which we don't use).

	  Regardless, it should never be necessary to install development
	  headers for libXp just to build xastir, which was what one user
	  was confused about and which led me to remove the check in the
	  first place.

2007-01-24 13:19  tvrusso

	* configure.ac: Remove probe for the X Printing Extension library.

	  Xastir doesn't use it, and there's no point probing for it.

	  Someone was confused into thinking they needed to install it on

	  They don't, coz we don't use it.

	* src/maps.c: Changing strcasestr to strstr for Cygwin
	  compatibility.  We don't really need case-insensitive matching
	  there anyway.

2007-01-12 09:13  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: A fix for the GraphicsMagick/ImageMagick problem
	  where GM is not on the system but Xastir tries to compile with
	  it.

2007-01-12 08:49  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c, src/messages.h,
	  src/messages_gui.c: Adding a "Show Pending Messages" menu option
	  to the Message menu.	This one looks through the outgoing queue
	  and brings up a Send Message dialog for each current QSO.

2007-01-09 09:33  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Another couple of tweaks to keep Lesstif from
	  segfaulting with the LSB compile.

2007-01-08 13:47  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Updated some comments.  No code changes.

2007-01-08 13:21  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Fixes to prevent segfaults with LSB-Xastir.
	  It appears that Lesstif cannot currently handle removing/adding
	  widgets to an already-realized dialog without segfaulting.  Here
	  we stick with the default one-long-input-field if we're compiling
	  for LSB.

2007-01-05 12:20  we7u

	* src/db.c: Moved the code which _only_ depends on
	  search_station_name() higher in the Station_data() function so
	  that the dialog doesn't get drawn if not needed.

2007-01-05 12:00  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD-ALL: Switching back to Lesstif-0.95.0 as 0.94.4
	  didn't improve things.

2007-01-05 11:52  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/maps.c: Fixing the print
	  properties dialog so that it only comes up if "gv" is detected.
	  Getting rid of gv-specific options on the command-line when "gv"
	  is not being used as a print-previewer.  Adding a couple of
	  strings to the language files.

2007-01-04 12:28  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD-ALL: Changing some comments.  No code changes.

2007-01-04 10:12  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD-ALL: Switching from Lesstif-0.95.0 to 0.94.4
	  for a while to see if the resulting binary is more stable.

2006-12-29 18:35  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Moving a new variable declaration above statements in
	  the function.

2006-12-29 10:57  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Moving many of the error messages to pop-up dialogs
	  for the user-instigated print and print preview functions.  We
	  also now allow a previewer other than "gv" to be used, although
	  we're still passing gv-specific parameters to it (something more
	  to fix).

2006-12-29 10:10  we7u

	* src/: maps.c, xa_config.c: Added #ifdef's for GV_PATH and
	  LPR_PATH so that we compile ok on systems which don't have these
	  two utilities.

2006-12-28 23:27  we7u

	* src/maps.c: More changes to printing.  Printing direct should be
	  functional now.

2006-12-28 22:37  we7u

	* src/: maps.c, maps.h, xa_config.c: Revising the new printing code
	  a bit more.  Now saves/restores the printer and previewer paths
	  from file plus allows the user to change them.  More to do yet.

2006-12-28 16:14  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, maps.h: A start towards having a separate
	  dialog for printing or print previewing/printing.  Not complete
	  yet, but shows the direction I'm heading.

2006-12-20 18:51  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Removing the libdb-5.0 options.

2006-12-20 16:04  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Fixing the variable save/restore code for the
	  GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick tests.

2006-12-19 22:54  we7u

	* scripts/get-maptools.sh: Adding checks for "wget", "gtar",
	  "bsdtar", "tar", and "gunzip".  The script will attempt to
	  configure to the set of utilities that are available.  If the
	  proper utilities cannot be found the script will exit before
	  downloading any files.

2006-12-19 17:38  we7u

	* scripts/get-maptools.sh: Searching for GNU tar before continuing
	  with the script.

2006-12-19 13:45  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c: Remove unused variable to silence warnings.

2006-12-19 13:39  tvrusso

	* src/: main.c, map_shp.c, util.c, util.h: A tiny addition: make
	  sure we always write out a valid ".prj" file to go with any of
	  the shapefiles we create (currently, that's GPS downloads and
	  saved APRS tracks).

	  Doing so makes sure that tools other than Xastir that use the
	  .prj file to determine the coordinate system of a shapefile will
	  know what's in there.  This includes OGR's projection
	  transformation tools, the QGIS GIS data viewer, and other GIS
	  software such as GRASS or (ugh) ESRI products.  It is a cardinal
	  sin to create GIS data that doesn't tell you what coordinate
	  system it's in.

	  Strike one dark stain from our souls.

2006-12-18 23:31  tvrusso

	* configure.ac: Switch default for rtree from no to yes.  It will
	  now build as long as shapefile support is building, unless
	  explicitly disabled.

	  Disabling rtree now requires "--without-rtree".

2006-12-18 13:09  we7u

	* xastir.spec.in: Forcing ImageMagick over GraphicsMagick, as that
	  is what is supplied with SuSE.  Also enabling rtree.

2006-12-18 13:09  we7u

	* xastir-min.spec.in: Forcing ImageMagick over GraphicsMagick for
	  this package, as that's what is supplied with SuSE.

2006-12-18 11:45  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Removing "/opt/lib" and "/opt/bin" for OSX search
	  paths as these are not used by DarwinPorts/MacPorts.

2006-12-18 11:35  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Simplifying the ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick
	  tests, but adding extra search paths when configuring on OSX.
	  Adding more libdb paths to the search paths for that library.

2006-12-18 11:30  we7u

	* configure.ac: Commenting out some warnings regarding ImageMagick
	  and GraphicsMagick: This info is self-evident in the configure
	  output now.

2006-12-16 22:55  we7u

	* scripts/get-maptools.sh: Taking out the hard-coded path to "tar".

2006-12-15 12:56  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Adding searches for ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick
	  in "/opt/local/bin" (OSX DarwinPorts).

2006-12-15 12:53  we7u

	* configure.ac: Correcting the GM/IM logic, adding comments.

2006-12-15 10:32  tvrusso

	* config/Makefile.am, config/stored_track.dbfawk, src/map_shp.c:
	  Add a Label field to the dbf file created by the "Store Track"
	  feature when shapelib is available.  Add a dbfawk file so that
	  stored tracks can be rendered properly even if they aren't in the
	  GPS directory.  Users can customize presentation of the stored
	  track by copying the global dbfawk file to the directory with the
	  shapefile, giving it the same basename as the shapefile, and
	  tweaking it as needed.

	  This should allow more convenient use of the maps created by
	  storing tracks than the method that based rendering on the file
	  name and directory.

2006-12-15 09:43  we7u

	* src/main.c: Reversing the order of the
	  HAVE_GRAPHICSMAGICK/HAVE_IMAGEMAGICK #ifdef's.

2006-12-15 08:06  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Reformatting a couple of lines.  No code changes.

2006-12-14 22:02  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c: Fix of my previous fix to the GPS vs. DBFAWK
	  issue.  Somehow I managed to get it to ignore the fact that the
	  file was in the GPS directory even when there *WAS* no dbfawk
	  file.  The problem was that I tested for the non-nullness of
	  "sig_info" after sig_info was filled in with a default
	  signature's pointer.	Needed to put the test before that default
	  case.

2006-12-14 13:22  we7u

	* configure.ac: Giving up for now on skipping the wget tests if
	  libcurl is found.  Also moved "rtree" out of the experimental
	  category, putting it up with the other regular options (above the
	  dashed line in the summary).

2006-12-14 12:17  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD: Added a comment.

2006-12-14 12:17  we7u

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Removing the tests for "cat" and
	  "cp".  Tweaking the "wget" code a bit more (but still not skipped
	  if libcurl is found first).

2006-12-14 12:15  we7u

	* src/: main.c, objects.c: Using the new copy_file() function
	  instead of /bin/cp.

2006-12-14 12:14  we7u

	* src/: util.c, util.h: Added copy_file() function written by Adam
	  Hahn, AI4QB, and contributed to the public domain.  We've
	  modified it from his initial code so any bugs are our fault.

2006-12-14 09:06  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Commenting out the code which checks for the "cat"
	  command.  We don't use it anywhere in our code.

2006-12-13 21:34  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Fixing some errors I introduced with the last
	  commit.

2006-12-13 21:02  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Improvements in the ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick
	  detection.

2006-12-12 22:50  tvrusso

	* src/: main.c, map_shp.c: Make DBFAWK trump the gps_flag.

	  This means that if a file is in the GPS directory and there is a
	  DBFAWK file to go with it, the DBFAWK file controls the
	  rendering.  It is still the case that if there is NO dbfawk file,
	  or if DBFAWK is not enabled, the hard-coded GPS stuff (i.e. fixed
	  width and line style, color taken from file name) is used.

	  Also, change the dbfawk file created upon GPS download to match
	  the style that the hard-coded GPS stuff would use.

2006-12-12 22:46  we7u

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: A few tweaks to the
	  GraphicsMagick/ImageMagick tests.

2006-12-12 19:06  we7u

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac, src/objects.c, src/xa_config.c,
	  src/xastir.h, src/maps.h, src/maps.c, src/main.c, src/map_WMS.c,
	  src/map_geo.c, src/map_tiger.c: Changes to allow using
	  GraphicsMagick library and "gm convert" in place of the
	  ImageMagick library and "convert".  Xastir will now prefer
	  GraphicsMagick over ImageMagick if both are present on the
	  system.

2006-12-12 09:57  we7u

	* scripts/: LSB-BUILD-ALL, LSB-BUILD-CURL, LSB-BUILD-DB,
	  LSB-BUILD-GDAL, LSB-BUILD-GRAPHICSMAGICK, LSB-BUILD-JASPER,
	  LSB-BUILD-JPEG, LSB-BUILD-LESSTIF, LSB-BUILD-PCRE, LSB-BUILD-PNG,
	  LSB-BUILD-ZLIB: Updating some comments.

2006-12-12 08:38  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD: Enabling the Festival client to be compiled
	  into LSB.  This has a couple of small downsides:  1) The user
	  will get a "cannot connect to Festival" message on start up if
	  they haven't installed/run the festival daemon, and 2) If
	  anything else is running on localhost TCP port 1314 Xastir may
	  try to talk to it.  The upside is that installing/running a
	  Festival daemon will work with the LSB binary to produce speech.

2006-12-12 08:36  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Removing define for FESTIVAL_PATH.  We don't use
	  this in our code, plus if we chose to later it'd make another
	  external dependency that'd need to be solved for the LSB
	  distribution.  I believe this was originally added in case we
	  wished to call the festival binary directly instead of doing a
	  TCP connection to the festival daemon on port 1314.

2006-12-12 07:49  we7u

	* README.win32, acinclude.m4, src/wx_gui.c: Getting rid of our
	  dependence on the "/usr/bin/finger" external executable.  It's
	  been replaced by our own TCP/IP finger code.	This is used for
	  fetching the NOAA weather text from "wxsvr.net".

2006-12-12 06:35  we7u

	* src/db.c: Comment correction.

2006-12-11 12:39  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD: Cleaning up the lsbappchk calls.

2006-12-11 12:38  we7u

	* LICENSE: Minor changes to comments.

2006-12-11 09:22  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD: A minor change to the flags for lsbappchk.

2006-12-10 20:19  tvrusso

	* src/main.c: Change the "display_level" value in the stuff output
	  as a dbfawk file for downloaded gps tracks.

	  The value that was there was absurdly low.

2006-12-08 21:02  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD-XPM: We don't appear to need a separate libXpm
	  so deleting the build script for it.

2006-12-08 21:00  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD-ALL: Removing the libXpm build as we're picking
	  it up automatically from somewhere else now that we've enabled
	  the header files for it.

2006-12-08 20:56  we7u

	* LICENSE: Removing libXpm license as we don't appear to need to
	  include a separate libXpm anyway.  We're already picking it up
	  from LSB or from Motif or something.

2006-12-08 13:48  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD-ALL: Putting the XPM build one step later.

2006-12-08 13:16  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD-ALL: Adding a comment about libXpm.

2006-12-08 13:14  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD-ALL: Adding libXpm build to the script.

2006-12-08 13:12  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD-XPM: An LSB build script for libXpm.

2006-12-08 13:11  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD: Adding libXpm instructions for the LSB build.

2006-12-08 13:10  we7u

	* configure.ac: Adding libXpm to the LSB build.  Needed for
	  Snapshots and Printing.

2006-12-08 13:09  we7u

	* LICENSE: Adding the license for libXpm.

2006-12-08 12:16  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD: Copying "gm" from GraphicsMagick into our LSB
	  build.

2006-12-08 12:15  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD-GRAPHICSMAGICK: Installing "gm" utility as well
	  (that's where we can get to "convert" in GraphicsMagick).

2006-12-08 12:14  we7u

	* src/main.c: Restarting the Xastir binary no matter where it was
	  configured to be installed.

2006-12-08 12:13  we7u

	* configure.ac: Setting defines for Xastir paths.  We can use them
	  in the C-code to do things like restart ourselves.

2006-12-08 12:12  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Setting up to be able to do Printing and Snapshots
	  with the LSB version.

2006-12-08 12:12  we7u

	* INSTALL: Documenting the depending on Xpm for Printing and
	  Snapshots.

2006-12-08 08:04  we7u

	* src/wx_gui.c: Fixing up the finger code for fetching NOAA weather
	  alert text.  We now pipe STDERR to STDOUT so that we can see any
	  errors in the dialog.  The syntax is shell-specific so we perhaps
	  need a better way to do it.  The syntax used should work for SH
	  or BASH shells, and I think Korn shell, but not for CSH?  We also
	  now use HAVE_FINGER defines to enable/disable the actual finger
	  call in the code.

2006-12-08 06:58  we7u

	* LICENSE: Changing some comments.

2006-12-08 06:45  we7u

	* src/wx_gui.c: Using the new FINGER_PATH that we now put into
	  config.h via acinclude.m4.

2006-12-08 06:44  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Adding a search for the "finger" binary.

2006-12-07 12:22  we7u

	* xastir-lsb.spec.in, scripts/LSB-BUILD: Changing install location
	  for LSB-like (non-certified) version from /opt/lsb-xastir/ to
	  /opt/Xastir/

2006-12-07 12:09  we7u

	* xastir-lsb.spec.in: Changing the install location from
	  /opt/lsb-xastir to /opt/xastir.  We don't have (and probably will
	  never request/pay for) LSB compliance.

2006-12-07 11:58  we7u

	* Makefile.am, xastir-lsb.spec.in: Adding more docs to the install
	  locations.

2006-12-07 11:49  we7u

	* scripts/: LSB-BUILD-ALL, LSB-BUILD-CURL, LSB-BUILD-DB,
	  LSB-BUILD-GDAL, LSB-BUILD-GRAPHICSMAGICK, LSB-BUILD-JASPER,
	  LSB-BUILD-JPEG, LSB-BUILD-LESSTIF, LSB-BUILD-PCRE, LSB-BUILD-PNG,

	  compliance.

2006-12-07 11:48  we7u

	* xastir-lsb.spec.in, scripts/LSB-BUILD: Adding a comment which
	  states that we do NOT have LSB-compliance.

2006-12-07 11:47  we7u

	* LICENSE: Documenting the licenses for the optional libraries that
	  we might distribute with an Xastir statically-linked binary.

2006-12-07 11:47  we7u

	* COPYING.LIB.LESSTIF: Adding the license file for Lesstif, for the
	  case where we're distributing an Xastir statically-linked binary.

2006-12-07 09:33  we7u

	* configure.ac, scripts/LSB-BUILD, scripts/LSB-BUILD-ALL,

	  scripts/LSB-BUILD-JPEG, scripts/LSB-BUILD-LESSTIF,
	  scripts/LSB-BUILD-PCRE, scripts/LSB-BUILD-PNG,
	  scripts/LSB-BUILD-ZLIB: More changes to the LSB Xastir build and
	  the LSB build for the optional libraries.  We now install the
	  libraries in /opt/lsb-tmp/ and then compile Xastir statically
	  against the libraries there, via symlinks from the
	  /opt/lsb/include/ and /opt/lsb/lib/ directories.

2006-12-06 11:46  we7u

	* scripts/: LSB-BUILD, LSB-BUILD-CURL, LSB-BUILD-DB,

	  LSB-BUILD-ZLIB: Minor tweaks for LSB compiling.

2006-12-06 11:45  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD-ALL: An one-stop-shopping script to build the
	  optional libraries under LSB before we compile Xastir under LSB.

2006-12-05 12:45  we7u

	* src/main.c: Correcting one comment.

2006-12-05 06:43  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD: Removing the gdal symlinks from the comments
	  as we've handled them in configure.ac/acinclude.m4 instead.
	  Xastir will look for gdal in /opt/lsb-gdal/lib and
	  /opt/lsb-gdal/include directories.

2006-12-05 06:42  we7u

	* configure.ac: Removing "(Experimental)" from the LSB summary
	  line.  Changing "lsb" to "LSB" which is more proper.

2006-12-04 11:52  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD-GDAL: Adding a commented-out option.  No effect
	  to the code.

2006-12-04 09:51  tvrusso

	* src/shapelib/contrib/: doc/shpproj.txt, tests/shpproj.sh: Just
	  noticed that I never cvs added these two files from the shapelib
	  distribution.  Since we are currently distributing the whole
	  shapelib distribution with unmodified license, it is necessary to
	  include all of the whole shapelib distribution.

2006-12-04 09:30  we7u

2006-12-04 08:27  we7u

	* src/util.c: Enabling CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL option to libcurl if the
	  libcurl version supports it.	This prevents segfaults for the
	  case where we get a DNS timeout when initiating a libcurl
	  transfer.

2006-12-03 14:01  we7u

	* scripts/LSB-BUILD: Changes in comments for GDAL compiling under

2006-11-19 14:05  tvrusso

	* README.win32: Another tiny update to README.win32 to bring it
	  up-to-date with the reality of today's cygwin and sync with the
	  Wiki HowTo:Windows page.

2006-11-19 14:00  tvrusso

	* README.win32: Fix up another little issue with this document.

	  I'm doing this piecemeal, because I'm finding things as I'm
	  editing the same information on the Wiki, and want this file to
	  be consistent with that.

2006-11-19 13:56  tvrusso

	* README.win32: Fix up a little error in the "building shapelib
	  from source" section.  It referred to a "_reent" error when
	  really it was about the error involving "__getreent".

2006-11-19 13:34  tvrusso

	* README.win32: Add note about preferring internal shapelib support
	  unless the external is needed for something other than xastir.

	  This should cut down on our "How do I get around this error
	  message..." support questions from new Cygwin users.

2006-11-17 07:45  kg4ijb

	* ChangeLog: [no log message]

2006-11-17 00:53  tvrusso

	* scripts/get-maptools.sh: Found yet another annoying issue with
	  libgeotiff build on ubuntu (and probably anywhere where gcc 4 is
	  used).

	  The problem is that the official tarball has the modification
	  times of configure.in newer than configure, and a makefile that
	  regenerates configure whenever it's older than configure.in ---
	  and then runs it with no arguments.  Since we need to run
	  configure with some arguments, that completely messes everything
	  up.

	  Add a "touch configure" command to the commented-out part of the
	  script that makes configure newer than configure.in and bypasses
	  that part of the  Makefile.  A kludge upon a kludge upon a
	  kludge.

	  I missed this subtlety because when I finally tracked down the
	  "ld -shared" issue, it was in a dirty directory -- one that had
	  already had configure regenerated and which therefore no longer
	  had the broken timestamps.

2006-11-16 21:31  tvrusso

	* scripts/get-maptools.sh: Add commented-out fix for GCC 4.x issues
	  with libgeotiff.

	  Not uncommenting them, because it might be wrong on some
	  platforms that don't use GCC at all.

2006-11-16 20:13  tvrusso

	* scripts/get-maptools.sh: A number of small fixes to the
	  get-maptools script:	 1) Make sure $XASTIR_TMP exists before
	  trying to download files into it   2) Fix a typo (LDCONf_FILE vs.
	  LDCONF_FILE)	 3) Update version of gdal to 1.3.2 (1.3.1 does not
	  compile in recent GCC)   4) Build geotiff before gdal, since gdal
	  will use the libgeotiff if it finds it.

2006-11-16 09:12  we7u

	* Makefile.am: Getting rid of the symlink I recently added which
	  pointed from /usr/local/share/xastir/doc to
	  /usr/local/doc/xastir.  Near as I can tell we're fairly well
	  FHS-compliant now with Xastir.

2006-11-15 12:11  we7u

	* Makefile.am: Forcing the removal of the old
	  $prefix/share/xastir/doc directory and creating a symlink to the
	  new location.

2006-11-15 11:49  we7u

	* Makefile.am, xastir-min.spec.in, xastir.spec.in: Moving the doc
	  files to an FHS-compliant directory.	For a user installing from
	  sources they'll get installed in "/usr/local/share/doc/xastir/"
	  instead of the old location of "/usr/local/share/xastir/doc".

2006-11-15 08:45  we7u

	* Makefile.am, xastir-min.spec.in, xastir.spec.in: Changing the man
	  page directory from $prefix/man to $prefix/share/man, per FHS-2.3
	  and LSB-3.1

2006-11-15 07:50  we7u

	* xastir-min.spec.in: Changing "--without-shapelib" to
	  "--with-internal-shapelib" to take adantage of the new shapelib
	  library we include with Xastir.

2006-11-15 07:48  we7u

	* .cvsignore: Adding two derived files back in.

2006-11-15 07:47  we7u

	* xastir-min.spec, xastir.spec: Put these files into CVS by
	  mistake.  They are derived files.  Silly me.

2006-11-15 07:08  we7u

	* scripts/BUILDRPMS: Changing the "minimum" description to include
	  building with internal Shapelib.

2006-11-15 07:08  we7u

	* .cvsignore: Updating for current list of files.

2006-11-15 07:07  we7u

	* xastir-min.spec, xastir.spec: Adding the spec files that I've
	  been using.  I'm surprised that they weren't added before, but I
	  had added them to my .cvsignore file and so didn't notice.

2006-11-14 13:30  we7u

	* src/shapelib/dbfopen.c: The last revision also commented out an
	  unused variable that I forgot to mention in the cvs log.

2006-11-14 13:28  we7u

	* src/shapelib/: shpopen.c, shptree.c: Commenting out some
	  variables that give off compiler warnings.

2006-11-14 13:28  we7u

	* src/shapelib/dbfopen.c: Casting a couple of variables to int's to
	  get rid of compiler warnings.

2006-11-14 12:58  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started: Adding missing command-line options to
	  the docs.

2006-11-14 12:42  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Changing some default settings, useful for
	  first-time users of Xastir to see what more of the options might
	  be plus give them a good operational starting point.

2006-11-14 12:09  kg4ijb

	* ChangeLog: [no log message]

2006-11-14 11:52  we7u

	* configure.ac: Fixing up the Shapelib config options.

2006-11-14 11:52  we7u

	* xastir.1: Updating the man page a bit.

2006-11-14 08:28  we7u

	* configure.ac: Changes to make it obvious in the configure output
	  text and in Help->About that we're using the internal Shapelib.
	  This change doesn't affect summary.log.

2006-11-14 07:41  we7u

	* src/main.c: Putting a newline in front of the Motif version
	  string in Help->About.

2006-11-14 00:19  tvrusso

	* configure.ac: Fix the "-I" flag in CPPFLAGS when local shapelib
	  is being built.

	  As it was, the compiler would not find the local shapefil.h file
	  unless you were building in the actual xastir source code
	  directory, or if shapefil.h was already installed system-wide.

	  Noticed this while attempting a fresh build on a brand new
	  laptop, on which I'd decided to attempt the simplest possible
	  build, with no shapelib installed.

2006-11-13 11:46  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started: Added notes about the private copy of
	  Shapelib and when it might be used, the "wget" requirement for
	  the get-NWSdata script, putting in a callsign when initially
	  starting Xastir, and a list of various places to get Xastir help.

2006-11-13 11:43  we7u

	* README.win32: Mentioning the private Shapelib version and when it
	  might be used.

2006-11-13 11:43  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Mentioning "wget" as a requirement for get-NWSdata.
	  Mentioning the private install of Shapelib.

2006-11-13 11:41  we7u

	* INSTALL: Adding info about the alternate method of getting
	  Shapefile support.

2006-11-13 07:10  tvrusso

	* README.Contributing: Fix up a mistake in the description of
	  "build directories", and add a reference to that technique to an
	  earlier section that advocates doing all the builds in the source
	  directory.

	  Build directories are such a powerful tool for developers, we
	  should make sure we recommend it when talking about doing
	  multiple builds.

2006-11-13 06:56  tvrusso

	* README.win32: Attach a date to qualify the meaning of "latest" in
	  the ImageMagick section.

2006-11-13 06:48  tvrusso

	* src/Makefile.am: Add a testawk_LDADD line to src/Makefile.am so
	  that this test program can link if shapelib is not installed.

	  I have no idea why this didn't fail when I was testing the
	  shapelib addition.

2006-11-13 06:25  we7u

	* README.win32: Updating the description for ImageMagick bug.

2006-11-13 06:24  we7u

	* src/: .cvsignore, shapelib/.cvsignore: Adding another couple of
	  derived files to the .cvsignore file.

2006-11-12 17:36  we7u

	* src/main.c: Enabling default map on initial startup, plus if the
	  callsign is "NOCALL", bring up the Configure->Station dialog.

2006-11-12 17:26  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Getting rid of many of the messages you get on
	  startup when config file settings are missing.

2006-11-11 16:26  tvrusso

	* src/shapelib/contrib/Makefile.am: Add CVS revision information
	  and copyright.

2006-11-11 16:11  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Adding attribution for the default map.

2006-11-11 15:46  tvrusso

	* configure.ac, src/shapelib/Makefile.am, src/shapelib/shprewind,
	  src/shapelib/contrib/.cvsignore, src/shapelib/contrib/Makefile,
	  src/shapelib/contrib/Makefile.am,
	  src/shapelib/contrib/Makefile_orig: Add EXTRA_DIST and
	  DIST_SUBDIRS lines so that the shapelib stuff is properly bundled
	  when doing a "make dist" for release.

	  The Makefile.am in the contrib directory does not actually build
	  any of the contrib codes.  That's another step for another
	  moment.  I just wanted to make sure that any make dist that is
	  done is sure to bundle the entire shapelib directory in order to
	  comply with the terms of the license.

	  The "Makefile_orig" script in the shapelib/contrib directory
	  could be used temporarily to build the shapelib tools.
	  Ultimately, they could be built by the new makefile, but it's not
	  really the goal of this exercise to do all that.  In fact, at
	  some point it might be reasonable for xastir's shapelib directory
	  to contain only the files needed for building the library, but
	  that will probably require modifying it to be under GPL instead
	  of LGPL.  That's just a matter of editing some license files, not
	  any code.

	  Also, removed the shprewind file from the shapelib directory.
	  This is a linux binary that for some reason was in the shapelib
	  source tarball I had.  It should never have been added to
	  xastir's CVS repository.

2006-11-11 15:01  we7u

	* Makefile.am: Adding a default map to the distribution.

2006-11-11 14:51  we7u

	* worldhi.map: Adding a default map.  Map was created by Keith
	  Sproul, WU2Z, and used with his permission.

2006-11-10 13:49  tvrusso

	* src/shapelib/.cvsignore: Add .cvsignore.

2006-11-10 13:49  tvrusso

	  an external one.

	  Make a loud warning if we do so, because the result of this is
	  that we'll have a bigger executable.

	  This commit is bigger than it needs to be, because it includes
	  all of shapelib, including the contrib directory.

	  Added an automake-generated Makefile for this thing.

	  Builds only a static library, and calls it "libshape.a" instead
	  of "libshp.a" so that if we use ask to use the static one while
	  there is also an external one installed, the linker doesn't pull
	  in the shared library one unbidden.

	  This stuff can be tested on a system with libshp installed by
	  configuring with "--without-shapelib"

	  I will be removing Makefile.in because it's not supposed to be in
	  CVS.	My mistake.

	* ChangeLog: [no log message]

2006-11-09 08:23  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Changing the default window size on initial
	  startup.  The minimum width/height are set up in
	  main.c:create_appshell() anyway, so we can't reduce the window
	  small enough to cause segfaults by doing this change.

2006-11-09 08:21  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changed one comment.  No code changes.

2006-11-05 17:16  tvrusso

	* README.win32: Add information about problems with Cygwin
	  ImageMagick.	The notes in the README.win32 refer to "recent
	  versions" of cygwin containing ImageMagick 5.5.7, which is very
	  outdated.  Current versions of Cygwin come with 6.0.4, and there
	  are real problems due to that version being linked with Display
	  Postscript support --- X.org stopped supporting that, and now
	  ImageMagick doesn't work on Cygwin unless you find a few DLLs off
	  the net.

	  The paragraph I added here points the user at an article that
	  explains the issue and shows two workarounds (installing the DLLs
	  or building ImageMagick from source code instead).

2006-11-03 12:31  we7u

	* src/util.c: Adding a diff by Tapio Sokura, which a few comment
	  changes by me.  Thanks! This fixes the lower-case callsigns
	  problem for internet paths.

2006-11-02 10:34  we7u

	* scripts/BUILDRPMS: Setting up for building RPM's for the current
	  development version.

2006-11-02 08:03  we7u

	* configure.ac: Setting up for the next development source version
	  number.

2006-11-02 06:43  we7u

	* configure.ac, scripts/BUILDRPMS, scripts/do_xastir_release_dev,
	  scripts/do_xastir_release_stable: Setting up to do the 1.8.4
	  release.

2006-11-01 06:57  we7u

	* config/language-German.sys: Updates by Rolf Bleher.  Thanks!

2006-10-26 08:52  we7u

	* Davis/: configure.ac, src/db2APRS.c, src/defs.h: Tweaks by Bruce
	  Bennett:  "I fixed some issues brought out by the latest MySQL
	  (5.0.x ver), added metric/english switch, rooted out some old
	  bugs and made some improvement on debug messages."

2006-10-26 06:50  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing problems with Aloha circle units in multiple
	  places.

2006-10-25 08:16  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Lining up the line to match the rest.

2006-10-24 11:03  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Adding another test which disables the
	  /usr/include/magick/ directory before attempting a compile.  This
	  disables ImageMagick.

2006-10-24 11:02  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Adding another two ifdef's so that the code will
	  compile in the case that we have XPM support but no ImageMagick
	  support.

2006-10-11 14:39  we7u

	* src/db.c: Another patch by Jesse, KF4HZU.  Thanks!

2006-10-05 09:11  we7u

	* src/db.c: Skipping any processing of lines from logfiles that
	  begin with '#'.

2006-10-05 08:29  we7u

	* src/db.c: A fix for numeric overlays on base-91 packets by Jesse,
	  KF4HZU.

2006-10-05 07:46  we7u

	* src/db.c: Some SKY bulletins came in that had "EMERGENCY" in the
	  text.  This caused Xastir to try to process the packets twice on
	  order to get a position first and then pop up the emergency
	  dialogs.  Since there was no position in the packet this caused
	  an infinite loop as Xastir passed the packet through the
	  processing again and again.  The fix is to NOT send a packet
	  through the processing again, which will make it necessary for
	  Xastir to receive two EMERGENCY packets if a position is not
	  known yet for the station, but it will at least not cause Xastir
	  to get in an infinite loop.  We also skip storing any SKY packets
	  now as they just take up memory and we never do anything further
	  with the packets.

2006-09-27 12:23  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Adding US National
	  Grid designator to the MGRS label.  If in NAD83/WGS84 they are
	  equivalent.

2006-09-25 06:24  we7u

	* src/main.c: A tweak by Dick Reichenbach, KC8OBZ, to split the
	  status line into two lines when using a 640x480 display.  Thanks!

2006-09-20 08:22  tvrusso

	* src/interface.c: Add comments to show where it is necessary to
	  fix data_out_ax25 so that it isn't confused by leading
	  white-space in commands.

	  No code changes.  The idea was to document what I know I need to
	  do to fix the problem that Mike Fenske saw when the \r was added
	  before MYCALL commands.  The quick fix was not to add the \r if
	  sending to an AX25 port, but the clean fix would be to make
	  data_out_ax25 not care about leading white space.

2006-09-19 20:14  tvrusso

	* src/interface.c: What might be a less intrusive way of
	  introducing that extra carriage return into the MYCALL line.

	  The code for AX25 ports tries to decode the mycall line, and that
	  decoding was getting confused by the leading \r.  This quick
	  "fix" simply checks to see if we're writing to an AX25 port, and
	  if so, doesn't add the \r.

	  A more correct way to fix this would be to fix the decoding of
	  MYCALLs by data_out_ax25 so it doesn't get tripped up by the
	  first \r.  This is meant to be a quick hack to let both things
	  work properly until I figure out how to desensitize
	  data_out_ax25.

2006-09-19 19:55  tvrusso

	* src/interface.c: Removing carriage return I had put in before
	  MYCALL sent to TNCs.

	  The original intent was to do what was supposed to be an
	  inconsequential extra carriage return when writing to the TNC to
	  work around  some garbled data issues that are happening on
	  D700s.

	  Unfortunately, some bit of code downstream of
	  "output_my_aprs_data" is seeing the extra carriage return and
	  screwing up.	Bleah.

	  Removing the "fix" until I figure out what is going on.

2006-09-19 09:12  chicoreus

	* src/list_gui.c: Removing double cast.

2006-09-19 08:58  chicoreus

	* src/: database.h, db.c, list_gui.c: Fixing bugs in previous
	  commit.  Added note about database.h being name used instead of
	  db.h Previous commit email message bounced, changes were:

	  1) Converted hard coded MY_TRAIL_DIFF_COLOR to user configurable
	  my_trail_diff_color and added to configuration ui and config
	  file.  2) Linked station icon in station list to an onclick
	  callback to center the map on the station.  Included alternate
	  callback to pop up station details window.  Needs checking, as I
	  think the callback needs to filter mouse events.  3) Added, but
	  haven't yet internationalized display of area in acres when
	  measuring distances/areas on the map.  Needs to be generalised
	  and linked to all the places display of an area might be desired.

2006-09-19 07:43  chicoreus

	  src/list_gui.c, src/main.c, src/main.h, src/xa_config.c: Three
	  changes: 1) Converted hard coded MY_TRAIL_DIFF_COLOR to user
	  configurable my_trail_diff_color and added to configuration ui
	  and config file.  2) Linked station icon in station list to an
	  onclick callback to center the map on the station.  Included
	  alternate callback to pop up station details window.	Needs
	  checking, as I think the callback needs to filter mouse events.
	  3) Added, but haven't yet internationalized display of area in

2006-09-19 06:55  we7u

	* src/db.c: Removing the '*' after our callsign when injecting
	  packets into the internet (our injection ID that we add).

2006-09-15 09:59  tvrusso

	* src/interface.c: Inexplicable fix for an equally inexplicable but
	  very persistent problem.

	  My Kenwood D700 complains loudly ("EH?") almost every time Xastir
	  tries to set MYCALL before a posit.

	  This commit adds a carriage return right before MYCALL is sent.
	  For whatever reason, this eliminates the problem.  Clearly, the
	  d700 gets in some strange state where the first command sent
	  after re-entering command mode is not recognized every time.

	  Since a failure of MYCALL to be set before transmit can mean the
	  wrong callsign (or NOCALL) being attached to a posit, this is
	  potentially a significant fix.  I will comment more on it in a
	  follow-up email to the users mailing list.

2006-09-15 09:53  we7u

	* INSTALL: A tweak by Chip, N1MIE.

2006-09-10 18:03  we7u

	* src/db.c: Backing out the igate changes until they can be tested
	  further.  They appear to have broken most or all igating -> RF.

2006-09-08 17:35  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c, main.h, messages.c, messages_gui.c,
	  popup_gui.c, track_gui.c: Implementing command-line flags for
	  tracking a station and for disabling popups plus disabling Send
	  Message dialogs on incoming messages.  May need some more
	  tweaking to get rid of all popups, but this should be a good
	  start.

2006-09-08 11:10  we7u

	* src/db.c: Attempting to igate more types of packets to RF, for
	  the cases where it is appropriate to do so.  This should fix the
	  directed query problem, at least when gating _to_ RF.  Will look
	  at the other case as well (gating->INET), which may not be
	  broken.

2006-09-02 16:43  we7u

	* src/db.c: Adding parsing for RDF packets, with checking to make
	  sure they really _are_ RDF packets this time.

2006-09-01 06:21  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added a date/timestamp to bearing/distance popup for
	  emergency packets.

2006-09-01 06:05  we7u

	* src/db.c: Tweaking the processing of emergency packets (Mic_E
	  packets and standard packets) so that the packet gets processed
	  twice if the first time comes up with a 0.0 distance (which means
	  an unknown distance).  This often allows us to match our distance
	  check ( < 280 miles ) the first time a packet is received,
	  instead of having to wait for the 2nd occurrence of the packet.
	  Also:  We now bring up a popup with the bearing and distance to
	  the emergency station if it passes our checks.

2006-09-01 04:46  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added another comment in the RDF section.

2006-09-01 04:45  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Changing input focus to the first message box
	  after sending each message.  For D700 or D7 mode to make typing
	  messages easier.

2006-08-31 14:36  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c, maps.c, maps.h, util.c, util.h: Writing wx
	  alerts to file in the correct format now.  Storing/restoring wx
	  alerts from file.  Fixed a bug in the weather alerts code where
	  they wouldn't draw right away.

2006-08-31 14:27  we7u

	* src/wx_gui.c: Skipping NULL alert entries instead of returning
	  when we hit the first one.  This lets us see all of the active
	  alerts.

2006-08-30 12:29  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c, main.h, messages_gui.c, xa_config.c: Logging
	  for messages and weather alerts.  Starting to add more buttons to
	  the Send Message->Change Path dialog.

2006-08-30 12:21  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: Putting the files in correct alphabetical order.

2006-08-30 04:38  we7u

	* src/db.c: This change implements the capability to receive
	  messages that were sent to our other SSID's.	We don't ack them.
	  They cause a Send Message box to pop up like normal except
	  there's a special note prepended to each message line stating
	  which SSID the message was sent to.  This allows us to catch
	  messages sent to our other stations and respond to them if
	  desired.  We skip displaying these messages if the message
	  originated from our station, as two message boxes for the same
	  QSO is very confusing (and unnecessary).

2006-08-30 04:12  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Fixes for KISS mode when using "DIRECT PATH".

2006-08-29 15:34  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Adding context-sensitive Send Message To
	  option to the mouse menu.

2006-08-29 15:26  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Changing to APRHH and APHH as the TOCALLS
	  which mean a HamHUD.

2006-08-29 15:24  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c: Making "Mine Only" take precedence over
	  the range in the View->Messages dialog.

2006-08-29 07:31  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Minor fixes to the Send Message changes.
	  Tied the select_station_type capability into the New/Refresh
	  Callsign button as well.

2006-08-29 05:15  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Checking for blank strings in config file,
	  replacing with defaults where it makes sense.

2006-08-28 18:01  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Fixing HamHUD-II detect and setting max size
	  of messages to 20 for that device.

2006-08-28 16:23  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Initial attempt to have the Send Message
	  dialog automatically choose the HamHUD/D700/D7 settings based on
	  the remote station.

2006-08-28 12:29  we7u

	* src/: messages.c, messages.h, messages_gui.c: Added Send Message
	  formatting for HamHUD 20-character display.

2006-08-25 15:33  we7u

	* src/: db.c, messages.c, messages.h, messages_gui.c: Adding error
	  messages to the Send Message dialog.	Fixing directed queries.
	  Adding D7A and D700 input modes to the Send Message dialog.
	  Fixed a long message bug so 67-char messages can now be sent.

2006-08-25 15:24  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,

	  warning messages for the Send Message dialog.

2006-08-25 04:42  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changed the Capabilities display in View Incoming Data
	  so that it shows my own outgoing ?IGATE? packets as well.

2006-08-25 04:25  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Updated some comments.  No code changes.

2006-08-24 16:49  we7u

	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/main.c, src/main.h,
	  src/messages_gui.c, src/view_message_gui.c: Implementing Station
	  Capabilities and Mine Only options on Incoming Data dialog.
	  Added Mine Only and interface selection options to View Messages
	  dialog.

2006-08-24 16:29  we7u

	* src/popup_gui.c: Protecting popup functions from possible bad
	  inputs.

2006-08-23 13:45  we7u

	* src/db.c: Implemented 120-second random delay before responding
	  to an ?IGATE?  query.  Implemented the response for an ?APRS?
	  query, including the 120-second random delay.

2006-08-23 08:53  we7u

	* src/main.c: Refuse to print out the measured angle for the case
	  where we're doing on-screen measuring at zoom==1.  Angles change
	  at that zoom level.

2006-08-23 08:09  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Adding a comment about a future Terra/Toposerver
	  enhancement: Crossing UTM zone boundaries, splitting the map
	  fetch into two fetches.

2006-08-23 07:14  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added more debug output from map_visible()

2006-08-23 07:14  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Separating "zstr" used in UTM->lat/long calls into
	  zstr0 and ztr1.  We were running into problems when we crossed
	  UTM zones with a map.

2006-08-23 07:12  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added a method to have Xastir spit out coordinates in
	  Xastir Coordinate System.  Change a global variable at the top of
	  main.c to a 1 to enable it.

2006-08-23 05:19  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Adding some debug statements.

2006-08-23 05:17  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Changing one comment.

2006-08-23 05:17  we7u

	* src/main.c: Moving reload_object_item() and
	  Restore_CAD_Objects_from_file() from main() up into UpdateTime().
	  This is so that the image can be created and the global map
	  corner variables updates first.  Points were getting rejected on
	  loading because these variables were not initialized yet.

2006-08-22 11:20  tvrusso

	* src/messages_gui.c: Fix the
	  Send_message_change_path_destroy_shell function so it doesn't
	  ever try to destroy a shell when the pointer is null.

	  This was causing segfaults for me whenever a messaging dialog was
	  closed, whether I'd accessed a change_path dialog or not.

2006-08-22 08:27  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Closing the Change Path dialog if the Send
	  Message dialog is closed.

2006-08-22 07:20  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Setting the path and change path widgets so
	  that they stretch properly with the dialog.

2006-08-22 07:12  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Simplifying the Send Message dialog a bit
	  more, taking the Reverse Path widgets out of that dialog.  They
	  still exist in the Change Path dialog.

2006-08-22 05:35  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Minor adjustments to the widgets of the Send
	  Message and Change Path dialogs.

2006-08-22 04:55  we7u

2006-08-22 04:08  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Changing reverse-path calculation to get rid
	  of Q-construct and anything after it before reversing the path.

2006-08-21 19:35  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: A better Send Message dialog.  More testing
	  to be done yet, but so far it looks better than the old.

2006-08-21 18:01  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, messages.c, messages.h, messages_gui.c: The
	  beginnings of a separate dialog for changing the path from the
	  Send Message dialog.	Mostly working as-is but not very pretty.

2006-08-21 09:18  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Added some TODO comments to Send_Message().

2006-08-21 06:58  we7u

	* src/popup.h: Cranking up max popups to 30.

2006-08-21 06:33  we7u

	* src/db.c: A fix for bug #1474401, where an auto-answer or some
	  other message to us which doesn't have a message-ID ends up
	  showing up in a Group Message dialog.  This fix makes them appear
	  in a Send Message dialog, plus we refuse to ack them which is
	  correct behavior.

2006-08-21 04:44  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing from a 1us delay to a 2ms delay inside
	  UpdateTime().  Adding/ changing some comments.

	* src/interface.c: Moving one debug line inside the data_lock block
	  to make sure it doesn't get corrupted by another thread.

2006-08-19 15:19  we7u

	* src/interface.c: More correct fixes for truncation problem with
	  new incoming data queue code.

2006-08-19 11:54  we7u

	* src/interface.c: A fix for the circular queue pointer problem.
	  The read pointer was not getting advanced in the same manner
	  around the queue as the write pointer, giving us an off-by-one
	  error.

2006-08-19 10:42  we7u

	* src/interface.c: A temporary fix to the new queue code problem
	  where it truncates the last character off the strings.

2006-08-18 14:52  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c: Remove commented-out ifndef of label-skipping
	  code.  It won't be needed.

2006-08-18 08:28  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Adding an #ifndef block for Tom Russo to play
	  with.  Currently commented out.  If the block is enabled it will
	  cause Xastir to draw every label for each polyline instead of
	  skipping some based on zoom level.

2006-08-18 06:57  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Added some comments.

2006-08-18 04:07  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, interface.h, main.c: Shortening the delay at
	  the end of UpdateTime() again to 10.	Global variables for
	  passing data from the read threads to main have been changed to a
	  circular queue.  This lets us queue up data from the read threads
	  when we're busy drawing maps and such, then process it quickly
	  when we're freed up.

2006-08-18 04:02  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Shortening delays so that we don't corrupt
	  packets if we're fed them quickly by the pipe from Xastir.

2006-08-17 05:59  we7u

	* src/database.h: Renaming a function parameter so that it's not

2006-08-17 05:47  we7u

	* src/db.c: Renaming a function parameter so that it won't be

2006-08-14 13:06  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Fixing an infinite loop condition that can happen
	  if a Shapefile has points below -180.0 or above 180.0.

2006-08-14 12:38  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c: Changing from "sed --in-place" to "sed -i",
	  perhaps more compatible across versions?

2006-08-14 12:34  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c: Fixing findu.com fetch trail function for
	  base-91 packets w/no comment/course/speed/altitude.

2006-08-14 11:01  we7u

	* FAQ: Added another bit to the "remote restart" section.

2006-08-14 08:53  we7u

	* src/map_gnis.c: Reorganization to provide speedups.  This one
	  cuts about 50% of the time when zoomed in.

2006-08-14 08:52  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Limiting to screen size instead of +/-32767.
	  Added a comment about another possible optimization.

2006-08-14 05:24  we7u

	* INSTALL: Adding an invocation line for gprof that I use so I

2006-08-14 05:12  we7u

	* src/: map_gdal.c, map_shp.c, maps.c, maps.h: Removing error-text
	  parameter from map_visible_lat_lon() as we're not using it.
	  Changed the order of checks in map_visible_lat_lon() to perhaps
	  speed things up slightly based on which lines get his most often
	  (gprof). Changed skip parameter for HandlePendingEvents in
	  map_shp.c from 50 to 64, which is a power of 2 (perhaps faster?)
	  and roughly the switchover point (via gprof) for lower CPU.

2006-08-11 16:58  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.c, map_gdal.c, map_shp.c, maps.c,
	  maps.h, objects.c: Added dupe-checking for screen points to
	  draw_vector and draw_point.  Reduced the number of
	  HandlePendingEvents calls we're doing inside the inner loop of
	  map_shp.c.  The end result is a speedup in Shapefile drawing.

2006-08-11 05:04  we7u

	* src/maps.h: Getting rid of stub for recompute_lat_lon() function
	  which was deleted.

2006-08-11 05:03  we7u

	* src/: maps.c, util.c: Getting rid of duplicate code in the form
	  of recompute_lat_long() and the global variables it populated.
	  We have duplicate functionality in the f_NW_corner_longitude,
	  f_SE_corner_longitude, f_SE_corner_latitude, and
	  f_NW_corner_latitude global variables and the code that populates
	  them.

2006-08-10 09:15  we7u

	* src/db.c: Took out a bit too much on one of the previous 2 or 3
	  revisions.  Adding computation of screen coordinates back in for
	  trail labels.

2006-08-10 09:09  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.c, map_gnis.c, map_shp.c, objects.c:
	  Moving screen boundary checks into draw_nice_string() and
	  removing them from lots of other places.

2006-08-10 09:08  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Adding a clip2d_screen() function for line-clipping
	  to screen boundaries.  Not used yet.

2006-08-10 06:01  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added some sanity checking for dbfawk font_size
	  variable.

2006-08-10 05:41  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Added some comments.

2006-08-10 04:35  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing to draw_point() instead of XDrawPoint for the
	  vertice point drawing of tracklines.

2006-08-09 21:02  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.c, util.h, main.c, map_dos.c,
	  map_gdal.c, map_gnis.c, map_shp.c, maps.c: Adding protection for
	  the parameters of the XDraw* calls, making sure they don't go
	  over 16 bits.

2006-08-09 07:56  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Changing the lu16 inline function to pass
	  back the correct type and check against the correct max number.
	  Added a bunch of comments elsewhere.

2006-08-09 07:03  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Limiting params to X11 drawing calls to
	  16-bit values.  This should help prevent segfaults.  We're
	  actually limiting them more than we need to in most cases, but
	  this should be ok.

2006-08-09 04:36  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added a debug line and comment.  This one lets us play
	  with/display aloha circles on startup if uncommented.

2006-08-09 04:35  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Fix for Aloha circle not getting drawn if it
	  doesn't fit entirely on the screen.

2006-08-08 15:32  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: A fix for a permissions problem that happens
	  with compiledate.c every once in a while.  This fix is by Dan
	  Brown.

2006-08-08 15:30  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.h: Checking in a header file that didn't get
	  checked in with the other sources during the last commit.
	  Dropped a couple of parameters from the draw_symbol() function.

2006-08-08 12:41  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.c: Fixed draw_pod_circle(),
	  draw_bearing(), draw_phg_rng() and draw_DF_circle() so that they
	  draw even when the symbol is off-screen.

2006-08-08 07:34  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fix for ambiguity box not getting disabled.

2006-08-08 06:05  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added some comments about possible optimizations in
	  the draw_point and draw_point_ll functions.  Commented out the
	  check against drawing long vectors to screen there as the clip2d*
	  algorithms should take care of that for us.

2006-08-08 05:36  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Moving some of the functions to a different order
	  that makes more sense.  No real code changes.

2006-08-07 13:19  tvrusso

	* config/: 24kgrid.dbfawk, nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsmzddmmyy.dbfawk,
	  nwsmzoddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsozddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsw_ddmmyy.dbfawk,
	  nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk, nwszoddmmyy.dbfawk, tgr2shp.dbfawk,
	  tgr2shppoly.dbfawk, tgrcty.dbfawk, tgrkgl.dbfawk, tgrlk.dbfawk,
	  tgrlpt.dbfawk, tgrlpy.dbfawk, tgrplc00.dbfawk, tgrwat.dbfawk: Fix
	  broken dbffields variables in all dbfawk files.

	  The dbfawk file is supposed to have semicolon-terminated
	  statements.  Unfortunately, the parser is busted and doesn't
	  actually handle the case where the semicolons are omitted
	  correctly.  So, for example,

	   BEGIN {
	    dbfinfo="Blah:Diblah:Diblahdiblah";
	    dbffields="Blah:Diblah:Diblahdiblah"
	  }

	  winds up getting the newline-space at the end of the line added
	  to dbffields, and thus in the list of names to be retrieved from
	  the dbf file.  This never matches the last field when applied to
	  the dbf files, which have no such extra characters in the field
	  names.

	  This bug is masked by *how* the dbffields variables were actually
	  set in the included dbfawk files:  BEGIN {
	  dbfinfo="Blah:Diblah:Diblahdiblah";
	  dbffields="Blah:Diblah:Diblahdiblah"}

	  That is, since there was no newline between " and }, dbfawk
	  didn't do the wrong thing.

	  Unfortunately, many people have patterned their own dbfawk files
	  after the ones in the config directory, and so this
	  missing-semicolon deal got propagated (I am among those
	  propagating it, as all my shape_web dbfawk files omitted the
	  semicolon, but also put the brace right after the ").  The
	  problem only gets exposed when the user inserts a newline after
	  the quote.

	  This commit adds the semicolon (and a newline) after the
	  dbffields closing quote.

	  The real fix is to fix the dbfawk/awk parser so it doesn't let
	  syntax errors like this slip through.

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Getting rid of unused code.

2006-08-07 06:37  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Adding clipt(), clip2d(), clipt_long(), and
	  clip2d_long() functions.  These are implementations of the
	  Liang/Barsky/Slater line-clipping algorithm.	Modified
	  draw_vector() and draw_vector_ll() to use them.  Changing cutoff
	  points for points/vectors to be consistent (+/-16000).

2006-08-07 06:33  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Changed one comment.  No code changes.

2006-08-04 07:35  we7u

	  Weather, status, etc.

2006-08-04 03:55  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing the display of altnet's.  Somewhere along the

2006-08-03 16:32  we7u

	* src/db.c: Tweaking the NMEA decoding routines so that they pass
	  back the number of digits after the decimal point.  Changing the

	  the "precision" rectangle.

2006-08-03 16:26  we7u

	* src/util.c: Fixing convert_lat_s2l() and convert_lon_s2l() so

2006-08-03 08:57  we7u

	* src/: db.c, objects.c: Fixing the problem where objects don't

2006-08-03 03:46  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, draw_symbols.c, draw_symbols.h: The

2006-08-02 17:19  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.c, draw_symbols.h: Changing "precision"

	  large at the moment, but at least of reasonable size.

2006-08-02 08:26  we7u

	* src/util.c: The chdir() call in log_data() appears to corrupt our

	* src/objects.c: Backing out the update of the Edit & Delete CAD
	  Objects dialogs when allocating the first vertice of a new CAD
	  Object.  It's a bit confusing when the windows move on top of the

2006-08-02 04:47  we7u

	* src/objects.c: Updating the Edit and Delete CAD Objects dialogs
	  at more places: *) When we create the first vertice on a new

2006-08-01 07:49  we7u

	* src/: objects.c, util.c: Effectively removing the rounding code
	  that was added on 6/21/2006.	The rounding was not done properly

2006-08-01 05:49  we7u

	* src/popup_gui.c: Bumping up the min size for popup messages
	  slightly.

2006-08-01 05:40  we7u

	* src/popup_gui.c: A start at fixing the problem where a popup
	  message will come up too small on the screen and can't be
	  resized.  We now set a minimum size and don't fix the size, so it
	  can be resized if necessary to read the message.

2006-07-31 06:42  we7u

	* src/objects.c: Fixed double-dash option for CAD objects.  Update
	  Edit/Erase CAD object dialogs if objects are changed.  Use
	  "<Empty Label>" names if no actual label is selected.  Commented
	  out one message to STDERR during normal pre-defined objects

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,

2006-07-25 07:53  we7u

	* src/util.c: A first attempt at snagging course/speed out of the
	  previous posit if the last posit doesn't have it, for
	  dead-reckoning purposes.  It will only do this if the previous
	  posit is still within the dead-reckoning timeout period.  The
	  goal here is to do dead-reckoning properly for stations which
	  alternate GPGGA/GPRMC sentences (GPGGA don't have course/speed).

2006-07-24 12:04  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Removing dead or useless code.  Reorganizing
	  some of the tests where we determine whether to draw a particular
	  symbol or attribute based on whether it is in the current view.

2006-07-24 12:01  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing to setting flags in the station record when
	  it's our station or object/item, then checking flags, instead of
	  checking the "call_sign" or "origin" constantly throughout the
	  code with string compares.  Got rid of the second drawing
	  iteration where we were drawing new stations to the screen _and_
	  to pixmap_final.  We now draw to the screen and rely on the next
	  full screen-update to do the rest.

2006-07-24 11:54  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing the -geometry flag so that it works for
	  strings like: "-geometry -0-0"

2006-07-22 07:47  tvrusso

	* src/dbfawk.c: Possible fix for bug that prevents dbfawk files
	  with a single field in the dbffields list from working unless a
	  colon is added to the end of the list.

	  This appears to be a very platform dependent bug, as I have never
	  been able to reproduce the problem.  But the fix is still valid
	  --- the issue is that no null terminator is added to a field name
	  unless a colon is found.

	  This fix doesn't break anything, but I'm unable to verify that it
	  actually fixes the problem reported, since I have never actually
	  seen that problem in action.

2006-07-20 13:05  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Dump a couple of messages out from map_indexer() to
	  STDERR.  This makes it evident why Xastir is so busy when first
	  started up in a fresh config directory, if there are a lot of
	  maps present on the system.

2006-07-20 12:28  we7u

	* src/main.c: Nope, 50 was too slow, but 25 looks good so far.

2006-07-20 12:23  we7u

	* src/main.c: Slowing down the main UpdateTime() loop again.  We

2006-07-19 07:40  we7u

	* src/: igate.c, interface.c, main.c, maps.c, messages.c,
	  xa_config.c: Fixes to get rid of complete path in the config file
	  for variables that need to change between different configs.	If
	  a user has specified a complete path (other than the default
	  path), Xastir will honor it.	If the default path is there,
	  Xastir will shorten it so that multiple configs may use it.

2006-07-19 04:27  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, list_gui.c, objects.c: Getting rid of
	  many of the is_my_call() invocations, instead setting flag bits
	  in the DataRow->flag variable to specify whether it's our
	  callsign-SSID or whether it's an object/item owned by us.  This
	  gets rid of literally millions of string compares.

2006-07-17 17:41  we7u

	* src/db.c: Skip doing dead-reckoning if scale > 8000.	Doing
	  point-caching of last-point-drawn in draw_trail() to reduce the
	  amount of drawing we do when it's the same screen pixel over and
	  over (when zoomed out).

2006-07-17 17:38  we7u

	* src/database.h: Adding a new flag definition in preparation for a
	  rewrite of the is_my_call() function.

2006-07-17 09:12  we7u

	* src/: map_WMS.c, map_geo.c, map_tiger.c: Patch for bug 1522493 by
	  Dan Brown, n8ysz:  The caching "bad" files problem.  It should
	  whack things out of the cache if, for whatever reason, they're
	  unusable.

2006-07-17 04:57  we7u

	* src/: main.c, xa_config.c, xa_config.h: More tweaks by Dan Brown,
	  n8ysz:  Cleaned up the get_user_base_dir() in xa_config.c to be
	  more careful about returning complete paths.

2006-07-16 12:02  tvrusso

	* src/: color.c, map_geo.c: Clean up transparency code for .geo
	  maps, removing debug output.

	  This now works properly for 16 and 24 bit DirectColor/TrueColor
	  displays.  It is horribly broken for 8-bit displays, but as far
	  as I can tell it was horribly broken *before* I started.  On
	  8-bit displays the WMSRadar image doesn't even get displayed,
	  transparent or not, before *and* after my changes.  I was unable
	  to figure out why.

2006-07-16 10:21  tvrusso

	* src/: color.c, map_geo.c: An interim commit of partial fixes to
	  the transparency problem on .geo files.

	  Mostly committing this to get it to a machine that has a display
	  that isn't 24-bit for testing.

	  Lots of cruft in here needs editing out after testing is
	  complete.

2006-07-14 11:50  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started, xastir.1: Updates by Dan Brown, n8ysz.

2006-07-14 08:53  we7u

	* src/: main.c, xa_config.c: Additions/fixes to implement alternate
	  Xastir config directories.  Patch submitted by Dan Brown, n8ysz.

2006-07-13 05:10  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata: Fixing up the domain names so that they all
	  match (for consistency).

2006-07-12 10:47  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata: Updating one NWS shapefile name to latest
	  version.

2006-07-12 10:47  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Updating the text for NWS Shapefile names to match
	  the NOAA website.

2006-07-12 07:24  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: A fix for the bug where text-on-black obscure
	  text above/below slightly due to the black background.  We now
	  separate the text by another pixel and the problem goes away.

2006-07-11 09:06  tvrusso

	* WMSRadar.geo: Tweak transparency value.  For some time now, the
	  actual "no reflection" value that's been coming in has been hex
	  value  0x010101, not "0x000000".  On 24-bit displays that means
	  that the default file was displaying with an opaque nearly-black
	  background instead of a transparent one.

	  The actual no-reflection value returned by the WMS server has
	  changed back and forth between 0x000000 and 0x010101 often in the
	  history of the WMSRadar file and will probably need to be changed
	  again some time in the future.  It has been pretty consistently
	  0x010101 for several weeks now.

2006-07-11 07:38  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing incorrect timestamps for local station.  This
	  was causing track points to get expired immediately so that the
	  station didn't show a track if being run with only a GPS
	  interface.

2006-07-11 06:02  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Fixes for dead-reckoning 180 degree problem
	  and for the DR arc being slightly off.

2006-07-11 05:18  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Removing dead code.

2006-07-11 05:06  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: More efficient dead-reckoning code plus
	  commenting out unused sections of code.

2006-07-11 04:41  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: More tweaks to dead-reckoning.  We now
	  attempt to display the arc and the DR'ed trail if either the
	  symbol or the DR'ed symbol are on-screen.  Added an "if" clause
	  to the DR'ed symbol drawing so it is only drawn when on-screen.
	  Commented out old code that we're not using anymore.

2006-07-11 04:01  we7u

	* src/util.c: Another fix by Dan Brown, n8ysz.	This one keeps the
	  log files at or below the max logfile size.

2006-07-11 03:59  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Removing a duplicate include line.  Thanks to
	  Dan Brown for finding it.

2006-07-10 20:15  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Implenting DR arcs again.  Problems near/at
	  180 degrees, but other than that it seems to work fine.

2006-07-10 10:24  we7u

	* src/db.c: Disabling the XtRemoveGrab() function call which causes
	  warnings on some OS'es.  I don't believe we actually need it.
	  We'll find out for sure when more users try out this version.

2006-07-10 10:23  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Test code for re-enabling the dead-reckoning
	  arc's.  Not complete/correct yet, but it's a start.

2006-07-10 09:40  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Fixes by Mike Loebl, kb1mts, to add barometric pressure
	  and humidity decoding to ARNE format.

2006-07-10 05:57  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing high CPU usage problems on FreeBSD, changing
	  nexttime from 2ms to 10ms.  Thanks to Carl Makin for this tweak.

2006-07-10 04:09  we7u

	* src/util.c: Fixes by Dan Brown, n8ysz, for Xastir bug 1518805:
	  "Log files can fill up hard drive".  We now limit a log file to
	  about 2MB at which point we roll it over to a new filename and
	  create a new empty file to write to.	We keep up to 3 of these
	  backup files plus the current log file at any given time, which
	  makes for between 6MB and 8MB of data that we keep.

2006-07-07 09:10  we7u

	* README.Contributing: Added a section by Dan Brown.

2006-07-07 08:06  we7u

	* scripts/BUILDRPMS: Tweaking the rev number.

2006-07-06 09:23  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixes by Dan Brown, n8ysz, for Xastir bugs 1515197
	  "segfault if XASTIR_USER_BASE no existing" and 1517761, "No error
	  check on config dir mkdir".

2006-07-06 08:36  we7u

	* src/: main.c, track_gui.c: Fixes for the blank label problem on
	  sliders with certain releases of OpenMotif.  This relates to
	  problems with using XtVaTypedArg within an
	  XtVaCreateManagedWidget() function.  Instead we now call
	  XmStringCreateLocalized() before the call, and XmStringFree()
	  afterwards.

2006-07-05 07:17  we7u

	* src/: Makefile.am, main.c: A patch to add compile time/date to
	  the Help->About dialog, by Dan Brown, N8YSZ.

2006-06-29 10:04  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Making the igate -> RF path default be
	  "WIDE2-1".

2006-06-27 07:25  we7u

	* src/igate.c: Reorganizing the logic slightly to make it easier to
	  understand w.r.t. the gating of objects/items/stations to RF via
	  the nws-stations.txt file.  Added/updated several comments.

2006-06-23 09:03  we7u

	* src/db.c: Adding more comments.  No code changes.

2006-06-23 08:31  we7u

	* src/igate.c: Changing igating->RF around so that if a station or
	  object name is found in the nws-stations.txt file, it will get
	  gated to RF whether or not "TCPXX" is found in the path.  This
	  allows more types of things to be gated to RF if manually
	  specified in the nws-stations.txt file.

2006-06-22 05:42  we7u

	* src/db.c: Mostly changes to comments, but changed the error
	  ellipses from black to white.  Still need to draw truncation
	  rectangles instead in some cases.

2006-06-21 07:49  we7u

	* src/objects.c: Tweaking the rounding in objects.c

2006-06-21 06:12  we7u

	* src/util.c: Changing some comments.

2006-06-21 05:41  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, util.c: Fixing up posits so that we round
	  properly instead of truncating the higher resolution digits.	For
	  some-odd reason the fprintf doesn't round up properly at 0.5, so
	  we add a 0.01 to the number so that it rounds up.

2006-06-21 04:51  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing one comment.

2006-06-20 05:55  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, draw_symbols.c: An attempt to do the
	  error ellipses for position packets.	This is most likely not the
	  display we'll finalize on, but it's a start.	We draw circles for
	  the less-precise posits, but as Tom Russo pointed out they should
	  probably be rectangles.  Also, the GPGGA/GPRMC/GPGLL code needs
	  some work w.r.t. these.

2006-06-19 14:47  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.c, draw_symbols.h: Making sure we don't
	  try to do dead-reckoning on stations that have position ambiguity
	  enabled.

2006-06-19 11:58  we7u

	* README: Adding notes for OpenSuSE 10.1

2006-06-16 13:29  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.c, draw_symbols.h: More ambiguity fixes.

2006-06-16 12:58  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c: Correcting the spelling of "ellipse".

2006-06-16 12:08  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Changes to a few comments.

2006-06-16 12:06  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, draw_symbols.c, draw_symbols.h: Adding a
	  variable for doing error_ellipses around posits.  Not in use yet.
	  Changed the position ambiguity around so that it is correct and
	  the symbol position inside the rectangle is correct.	Still need
	  to fix up the grid-square code in the draw_ambiguity function
	  though.

2006-06-15 14:28  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Fixing up some of the ambiguity rectangle
	  stuff.  All but the grid squares look ok now, but the smallest
	  rectangle ends up with the symbol placed off-center, which still
	  needs to be fixed.

2006-06-15 12:46  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Changing from stippled ambiguity rectangles
	  to solid lines.

2006-06-15 07:33  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Changing ambiguity rectangles from filled to
	  unfilled, plus drawing lines from symbol to each corner of
	  rectangle so we know which symbol is being drawn with the
	  ambiguity.

2006-06-14 13:55  we7u

	* src/database.h: Doesn't make much sense to add the new parameter
	  to the station database at this time when code doesn't use it.
	  It would only take up memory.  Commenting it out for now until we
	  get to using it.

2006-06-14 13:50  we7u

	* src/database.h: Preliminary addition of an error_elipse storage
	  area for the station record.	Not actually used in the code yet
	  as we're still discussing how it should best be used/displayed.

2006-06-14 07:17  gstueve

	* src/util.c: Only check VHF porion of path. Still need to process
	  2nd portion for proper behavior.

2006-06-14 07:13  gstueve

	* src/util.c: Only change lower case characters to uppper, don't
	  bother to rewrite upper.

2006-06-14 07:10  gstueve

	* src/util.c: Fix spelling in comment.

2006-06-12 09:17  we7u

	* FAQ: Added "socat" to the FAQ.

2006-06-08 14:04  we7u

	* src/: db.c, objects.c: Changed some comments to show the last
	  GPROF percentages for the heavy-hitters.  No code changes here.

2006-06-07 07:18  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.d700: Changed the comments at the top.  Added
	  note about Alinco's.

2006-06-07 07:03  tvrusso

	* FAQ: Update pointer to latest version of the FAQ.  The URLs that
	  were here were very outdated.

2006-06-06 12:22  we7u

	* src/db.c: Some packets with an extra digit in the latitude end up
	  going through the compressed packet decode routine.  This fix
	  causes those packets to be rejected from that routine.

2006-06-05 15:01  we7u

	* Davis/src/db2APRS.c: Davis mods by Clay Jackson, n7qnm.  Added
	  some MySQL error checking, set it up so it would always get the
	  'latest' records, and generally improved the error handling
	  (things like 0 or >100 pct humidity, pressure below 26 or above
	  31, and so on).

2006-06-05 12:20  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata: Tweaking the script so that it only fetches
	  files we don't already have.

2006-06-05 12:19  we7u

	* configure.ac: Bumping revision for devel to 1.8.3.

2006-06-05 11:50  we7u

	* configure.ac, scripts/BUILDRPMS, scripts/do_xastir_release_dev:
	  Updating to 1.8.2 to get ready for stable release.

2006-06-05 11:43  we7u

	* scripts/do_xastir_release_stable: Updating default version
	  number.

2006-06-05 10:14  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Added a section describing how to create your own
	  Shapefile maps with Xastir.  Added a section describing CAD
	  Object polygons.

2006-06-05 09:46  we7u

	* scripts/fcc-get: Updating to match newer "sort" function's
	  syntax.

2006-06-02 09:43  we7u

	* config/language-German.sys: Updates by DK7IN.  Thanks!

2006-06-02 08:35  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata: Updating to latest NOAA filenames.

2006-06-01 10:05  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Fixing the path for gpx2shape so that people look
	  for it in the scripts directory.

2006-06-01 10:04  we7u

	* scripts/Makefile.am: Adding gpx2shape to the build.

2006-06-01 10:04  we7u

	* scripts/gpx2shape: A nice contribution by James Washer.  Convert
	  GPX files to Shapefiles.

2006-06-01 09:35  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Added a blurb about National Geographic's Topo,
	  TPO/TPG files, mapXchange, gpsbabel, and gpx2shape.pl.

2006-06-01 07:17  we7u

	* README.MAPS: A bit added by Kyle Kienapfel regarding the Canada
	  topo file.  Thanks!

2006-05-31 13:39  we7u

	* src/igate.c: Disallowing igating of general queries in either
	  direction.  Directed queries still get gated as appropriate.

2006-05-31 13:36  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added some comments.

2006-05-31 12:57  we7u

	* src/: db.c, wx.c: Fixing the backwards conversions for wind speed
	  for Peet Bros.  Ultimeter-II weather stations.  The correct units
	  are km/h if the sentence begins with '#', and mph if the sentence
	  begins with '*'.

2006-05-31 12:30  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Changes to comments/added some comments.

2006-05-31 11:39  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Zeroing the first two digits on wind speed for Peet
	  Bros 2k as per the docs.

2006-05-31 11:25  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Changing a few variables to make the code more
	  consistent.  Instead of pointing back to the original data to
	  check for ">7", we look at the first character of our substring
	  temp_data1[0].

2006-05-31 11:09  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Fixes for Peet weather stations, negative value
	  decoding.

2006-05-30 13:06  we7u

	* src/map_gnis.c: Fixes to make Xastir handle the type of GNIS
	  files found at:
	  <http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/download_data.htm> which have
	  shorter lines than the ones at:
	  <http://geonames.usgs.gov/stategaz/>

2006-05-30 11:50  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Really complicated fix for Xastir dropping the
	  last character of a packet.  A fix for the last fix I put in.

2006-05-30 09:07  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changed one comment.

2006-05-30 08:18  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, interface.c, main.c: A bug fix for KISS
	  or AGWPE ports.  The AX.25 header increases in size when it gets
	  converted to TAPR2-style headers.  If there were enough
	  digipeaters in the path then the complete packet can get
	  truncated on the tail-end.  This patch fixes it by allocating a
	  separate buffer that is quite large for each packet before the
	  header decoding function.

2006-05-17 12:28  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing the reply-ack problem during messaging.  It was
	  an off-by-one error.	Our ack_string looked like "}5o" instead of
	  "5o", which made the comparison fail.

2006-05-13 09:27  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: Adding rpl_malloc.h to the build.

2006-05-12 13:32  tvrusso

	* FAQ: Add command for converting Root files to new scheme.

	  Of course, if someone could check this file out to see the
	  commands, they've already done the conversion...

2006-05-12 13:05  we7u

	* scripts/do_xastir_release_dev: Fixing a typo.

2006-05-12 13:03  we7u

	* install-xastir: Updating to the latest SourceForge CVS server
	  names.

2006-05-12 13:00  we7u

	* scripts/: do_xastir_release_dev, do_xastir_release_stable:
	  Updating to correspond to latest CVS server names.

2006-05-12 12:44  we7u

	  correspond to the changes implemented today on SourceForge.

2006-05-12 12:44  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.d700: Adding "HEADERLN off", which we appear
	  to have missed at some point.

2006-05-04 08:01  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a note about what to call COM1/COM2 in
	  Cygwin.

2006-04-29 10:19  tvrusso

	* symbols/symbols.dat: Change \V symbol (VORTAC) to something that
	  looks like what the other APRS codes use, matching the VORTAC
	  symbol on aviation charts.

2006-04-24 12:21  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, awk.c, bulletin_gui.c, color.c, datum.c, db.c,
	  dbfawk.c, draw_symbols.c, fcc_data.c, festival.c, geo-find.c,
	  geocoder_gui.c, gps.c, hashtable.c, hashtable_itr.c, hostname.c,

	  sound.c, testawk.c, track_gui.c, util.c, view_message_gui.c,
	  wx.c, wx_gui.c, x_spider.c, xastir_udp_client.c: More fixes for
	  rpl_malloc, plus made the callouts for config.h more consistent.

2006-04-24 10:20  we7u

	* src/: Makefile.am, festival.c, rotated.c, util.c, util.h:
	  Separating out the rpl_malloc code so that it can be used in
	  other programs like testawk.

2006-04-24 10:19  we7u

	* src/: rpl_malloc.c, rpl_malloc.h: Separating out the rpl_malloc
	  stuff so that it can be used in other programs like testawk.

2006-04-21 14:01  we7u

	* src/db.c: Correcting spelling in one comment.

2006-04-21 13:51  we7u

	* src/db.c: This change clears the transmitted message so it won't
	  get transmitted again after a REJ packet, and gets rid of a
	  printf to STDERR for each REJ.

2006-04-21 12:58  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added support for REJ packets, including igating of
	  same.  Yet to be tested.

2006-04-21 12:57  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Added a "*REJECT*"
	  string for REJ packets.

2006-04-20 09:47  we7u

	* README.win32: A tweak by Wes Johnston for getting bootstrap.sh to
	  run properly.

2006-04-20 08:05  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Reverting back to the code for version 1.54, as the
	  rounding for negative numbers wasn't done correctly and caused
	  more harm than good.

2006-04-20 07:22  we7u

	* symbols/: alert.xbm, flood.xbm, red_flag.xbm, snow.xbm,
	  tornado.xbm, wind.xbm, winter_wx.xbm, wntr_strm.xbm: Thanks to
	  Jason Winningham, kg4wsv, for these weather alert pics that stack
	  up much more nicely than the originals, while leaving more of the
	  map below visible.

2006-04-10 07:31  we7u

	* scripts/get-maptools.sh: Script to get/install several of the map
	  libraries, written by Dan Brown, N8YSZ.

2006-04-05 09:13  we7u

	* scripts/Makefile.am: Adding two of the newer scripts into the
	  Makefile.

2006-04-05 09:09  we7u

	* README.win32: A tweak by Joe Cotton to get the finger command
	  working in Xastir/Cygwin.

2006-03-16 18:32  tvrusso

	* INSTALL: Put the word "shapelib" closer to the place where we
	  explain how to install it, so it is more quickly found by a
	  search with "less" or "grep".

2006-03-16 00:03  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS: Fixx mispleling.

2006-03-16 00:02  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS: Added a little commentary about the mrsiddecode
	  program.

2006-03-13 17:40  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/objects.c: Shortening "Area" to
	  "A" for CAD objects.	Also shortening the unit descriptions.

2006-03-13 17:32  we7u

	* src/db.c: Refusing to do the emergency popups until/unless we
	  have a position for a station.  It's hard to help someone if we
	  don't know where they are at.  This keeps Xastir from annoying
	  the crap out of people every 30 minutes if a posit for that
	  station isn't coming in, but a packet with certain keywords _is_
	  coming in regularly.

2006-03-10 12:56  we7u

	* INSTALL: Added another note about libtiff-3.8.0

2006-03-10 12:45  we7u

	* INSTALL: Adding solution text regarding the libgdal/libgeotiff
	  GTIFProj4ToLatLong problem.

2006-03-10 12:28  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS: Fix a handful of mispleellings and mistales.

	* README.MAPS: Rearrange some of the discussion of how to
	  manipulate randomly mutilated GeoTIFF files.

2006-03-10 08:16  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Adding a section about using gdal_translate to
	  convert crappy geoTIFF's to usable ones.  Thanks to Tom Russo for
	  the info on how to do this.

2006-03-10 08:15  we7u

	* INSTALL: Slightly changing some wording in the gdal section.
	  Nothing of importance.

2006-03-09 12:47  we7u

	* INSTALL: Updating various library revision numbers.  Added a note
	  about a possible geoTIFF conflict when installing GDAL.

2006-03-09 12:46  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c: Making sure that Proj.4 error messages appear only
	  under the correct circumstances.

2006-03-08 18:43  we7u

	* src/db.c: Initial implementation of a distance check for
	  warnings/alerts.  Default is set to 280 miles or kilometers
	  (whichever mode you are set in), and the check defaults to ON,
	  meaning it will check each time whether the station is within
	  that distance.  This version has no user controls for the new
	  functionality implemented yet.

2006-03-07 18:44  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Fixing the rounding for some of the values that can be
	  negative, coming from weather stations.

2006-03-07 16:41  we7u

	* FAQ, README.Getting-Started, README.win32: Updating/Adding
	  instructions for snagging NWS files via new script.

2006-03-07 09:56  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Adding filename patterns to the NWS file
	  descriptions.

2006-03-07 09:56  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata: Adding the fire weather zones to the mix.

2006-03-07 09:05  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Adding a bit about the get-NWSdata script.

2006-03-07 09:04  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata: Modified the script to do one
	  download/unzip/delete the .zip file, then start on the next.
	  This will keep disk space requirements down plus not have the
	  .zip files hanging around when we're all done.

2006-03-07 08:53  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata: A new script to fetch NWS data files used
	  for weather alerts.  Curt, WE7U and Steven, WM5Z had a hand in
	  writing it.

2006-03-03 12:31  we7u

	* src/db.c: Checking for 8-bit characters in Mic-E packets, except
	  for the case of 8-bit telemetry extension fields where we skip
	  the check.

2006-03-03 08:19  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c: Re-enabling the popup on findu track download
	  failure, as it doesn't appear to be the source of James Ewen's
	  segfaults when his DNS failure occurs.  It appears to be a
	  segfault from libcurl itself.

2006-03-02 14:53  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a note about compiling libproj into gdal
	  statically in order to install on Cygwin.

2006-03-01 10:37  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.thd7: Commenting out the hbaud line and adding
	  a comment about it.

2006-03-01 08:30  we7u

	* README.Contributing: Added a note about core files appearing
	  where you least expect them.

2006-03-01 08:02  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c: Adding comments near another popup message that
	  could conceivably cause segfaults:  The "Success" message from
	  fetching a findu trail.  This particular popup has worked
	  properly for me with no segfaults so far.  We may need to
	  investigate whether multiple threads writing to X11 at the same
	  time can cause segfaults.  I believe I've seen this in other
	  cases, but my memory may be faulty on this matter.

2006-02-28 11:29  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c, src/maps.c, src/maps.h,
	  src/xa_config.c: Checking in mods by Dalen Kruse, KC0OVU, which
	  implement a timing slider for snapshots with a range from 1 to 30
	  minutes.

2006-02-28 00:01  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c: Getting rid of the GUI stuff in fetch findu
	  trail:  It happens in a separate thread now and we can't write to
	  the GUI from two threads at once due to possible segfaults.

2006-02-27 13:02  we7u

	* src/wx.c: A fix for negative values being interpreted incorrectly
	  due to varying sizes of INT on different systems.

2006-02-27 11:40  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.thd7: Changing HBAUD to 9600 so that it
	  matches the default serial port speed.

2006-02-24 19:01  tvrusso

	* src/db.c: Fix appallingly stupid mistake in passing arguments to
	  XtVaSetValues.

	  I coulda *sworn* I had just copied what was already there, but
	  apparently not.

	  This fixes the problem where the Incoming Data scrolled text
	  widget was not scrolling to the bottom of the incoming data as
	  new stuff was added.

2006-02-24 10:38  tvrusso

	* src/db.c: Complete refactor of how the "packet_data_string" stuff
	  is updated and displayed.

	  We no longer do "memmove" to cycle old data out of the array, but
	  rather use a two-dimensional array of strings treated as a ring.
	  Data is shifted out of the Display Incoming Data dialog box using
	  XmReplaceText calls.

	  I have tested this out in several ways and it appears to function
	  precisely as the old one was intended to do.	This *might* be the
	  solution to the sporadic segfaults we've been seeing and the less
	  harmful "line too long for array" warnings.

2006-02-23 16:38  we7u

	* src/db.c: Add a null pointer check to delete_station_memory().
	  Changed an "if" to an "else" clause in insert_new_station(),
	  which just made the code slightly simpler but didn't change any
	  operation.  Multiple comment changes.

2006-02-23 16:01  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Increasing the default for Internet Map Timeout
	  from 90 to 120 seconds.

2006-02-23 15:59  we7u

	* src/util.c: Adding messages something like "Possible timeout, try
	  increasing Internet Map Timeout" to the libcurl and wget code.

2006-02-22 08:53  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c: Adding grid labels for UTM major grid.  All grid
	  types and resolutions now have some kind of labeling available.

2006-02-22 08:51  chicoreus

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Added metadata
	  text for UTM major zones.

2006-02-19 12:50  rzg

	* src/dbfawk.c:
	  Small memory leak found by valgrind; I think this should fix it.

2006-02-19 12:02  tvrusso

	* scripts/object2shp.pl: Bug fix.  Make sure to ignore comment
	  lines in the object file, or any other lines that don't start
	  with semicolon.

2006-02-19 11:56  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS: Add explanation of how to use object2shp.pl into
	  README.MAPS under the "Rolling your own shapefile maps" section.

2006-02-19 11:48  tvrusso

	* scripts/: Makefile.am, object2shp.pl: Per discussion on xastir
	  mailing list, a script to create shapefile maps from the
	  object.log file.  This will enable quick and dirty generation of
	  special purpose map overlays by plunking down objects, creating
	  shapefiles, then deleting the objects.

2006-02-16 21:50  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, list_gui.c: Changing the names of
	  pointers so that their function is more easily recognizable.

2006-02-16 12:45  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Added more output messages in case of error which
	  suggest killing old Xastir processes in order to remove the
	  error.

2006-02-16 12:44  we7u

	* src/: db.c, messages.c: Fixing up msg_data_add() so that we can
	  tell when we've rejected a message.  Tweaked the code which
	  invokes it so that it knows the difference between
	  new/old/rejected messages.

2006-02-15 08:46  chicoreus

	* src/: maps.c, maps.h: Refinements to the calculation of latitude
	  and longitude grid spacing.  Triming the latitude and longitude
	  strings in the grid border when zoomed out.  Reduced the number
	  of variables being passed in the functions called by draw_grid()
	  by moving them to function calls or constants.

2006-02-14 14:00  we7u

	* src/db.c: Initializing struct pointers to NULL right after malloc
	  of the struct, before we try inserting it into any linked lists.

2006-02-14 13:11  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, gps.c, igate.c, objects.c: Converting all
	  MAX_TNC_LINE_SIZE (was 300) to MAX_LINE_SIZE (currently 512).
	  Just simplifying things.

2006-02-14 12:07  we7u

	* src/db.c: Printing out ALL of the guard bands that get corrupted,
	  not just the first one that's noticed.

2006-02-14 11:59  we7u

	* src/db.c: Adding a couple more guard bands, changing them to only
	  10 chars each, making the error text print out which guard band
	  was corrupted.

2006-02-14 11:34  we7u

	* src/db.c: Making the Incoming Data display's char array
	  manipulation code a bit less scary.  It had the potential to
	  overflow if conditions were just right, but the conditions were
	  extremely unlikely to occur.

2006-02-14 11:33  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Bumping up the sizes of some char arrays.  Just
	  because.  Probably don't help much, but don't hurt either.

2006-02-14 11:32  we7u

	* src/main.h: Removing some unused defines.

2006-02-13 12:30  we7u

	* src/: db.c, interface.c, interface.h, main.c: Adding guard bands
	  around the main station pointer variables, plus code to check for
	  intrusion into those guard bands.  This may help us to find the
	  current segfault problem.

2006-02-12 16:13  chicoreus

	* help/help-English.dat: Changing the grid border help to include
	  latitude and longitude.

2006-02-12 16:10  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c: First cut at an algorithmic method for determining
	  the spacing of latitude and longitude grid lines at a scale
	  appropriate for the current window size and map zoom.

2006-02-12 10:03  we7u

	* src/db.c: Correcting some debug output message text.

2006-02-11 18:10  we7u

	* src/db.c: Doing some more error-checking in the station record
	  pointers.  We do an abort() if we end up with dangling pointers,
	  which should give us a core dump immediately.

2006-02-10 12:27  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS, configure.ac: Tweaks to add more regression
	  tests and format the output so that it's easier to read.

2006-02-10 11:13  tvrusso

	* README.Contributing: Add a section on using separate "build
	  directories" to maintain specialized builds rather than building
	  in the source tree.

2006-02-09 17:08  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fixes for the map grid segfault problem.

2006-02-09 15:14  tvrusso

	* README.Contributing: Change commentary on how to do debugging
	  builds.

2006-02-09 14:32  we7u

	* README.Contributing: Adding a debugging note from Tom Russo.

2006-02-09 13:27  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Change XASTIR_COMPILER_FLAGS so that it doesn't
	  insert "-g -O2" unconditionally.  That is unnecessary since we
	  call AC_PROG_CC, which *conditionally* inserts "-g -O2" into
	  CFLAGS if the user hasn't specified CFLAGS on the configure line.

	  This should allow users to build specialized debugging versions
	  such as ./configure CFLAGS="-O -g -fno-inline" and not have
	  configure stick a "-O2" in unbidden.

2006-02-09 12:41  we7u

	* src/maps.c: A temporary fix to skip computing the UTM/MGRS grid
	  if we run into a problem, before we segfault.

2006-02-09 12:14  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Adding some comments.

2006-02-09 12:12  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Again splitting the minor UTM grid stuff into
	  separate functions.

2006-02-09 11:40  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Reorganizing the draw_grid() function.  Breaking it
	  up into smaller pieces.

2006-02-08 07:11  we7u

	* src/main.c: Checking for proper status of unlink in
	  pid_file_check().

2006-02-08 06:28  we7u

	* src/main.c: Removing some code that doesn't get used in the RINO
	  download section of the switch.

2006-02-06 18:37  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Commenting out unnecessary code.

2006-02-06 18:33  we7u

	* INSTALL, README.Getting-Started, UPGRADE, update-xastir:
	  Clarifying the use of SUID root a bit.  Removing that command
	  from update-xastir so that the default will be to create a core
	  file.

2006-02-06 13:35  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Some fixes for segfaults and divide-by-zero faults in
	  the draw_grid() function.  At least one more segfault path
	  remains in this body of code.

2006-02-06 09:03  we7u

	* README.Contributing: Adding more info to the debugger info.

2006-02-06 08:21  we7u

	* src/db.c: Tweaking Mic-E decoding logic to properly decode
	  overlay characters.

2006-02-03 10:09  chicoreus

	* src/util.h: Missing an extern

2006-02-03 09:47  chicoreus

	* src/: maps.c, util.c, util.h: Adding MGRS to labeled grid border.

2006-02-03 09:46  chicoreus

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Changing grid
	  metadata text to allow MGRS support.

2006-02-02 14:02  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Extending some char arrays so that they're long
	  enough to hold the terminator.

2006-02-02 10:58  chicoreus

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, util.c, xastir.h: Added degree and minutes
	  symbols to lat/long grid border labels by adding constants for
	  convert_xastir_to_UTM() to produce strings containing these
	  symbols.  Truncation of trailing zeroes on UTM grid labels, with
	  number of zeroes removed depending on utm_grid_spacing_m.
	  Changed following feedback from use of printed maps during a
	  GPSAR training.  Added internationalization for lat/long and UTM
	  grid border metadata.  Added metadata on top border for labeled
	  lat/long grids.  Latitude drawn on both left and right borders.
	  Put the xastir coordinate to MGRS conversion into a function that
	  extracts the components of the MGRS string separately, then made
	  convert_xastir_to_MGRS_str() a wrapper around this function in
	  prepration for labeling the MGRS grid.

2006-02-02 09:57  we7u

	* README.Contributing: Adding info about core dumps and how to
	  bring up a debugger.

2006-02-02 08:49  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started, src/main.c: Reversing the meaning of the
	  "-t" command-line flag:  The segfault handler is now turned off
	  by default (meaning we'll dump core instead).  The "-t" flag
	  turns on the internal segfault handler now instead of disabling
	  it.

2006-02-02 08:04  we7u

	* configure.ac: Commenting out the code that removed the "-g" GCC
	  option.  As Tom pointed out, it was a bad idea.

2006-02-02 07:29  chicoreus

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Added
	  internationalization strings for metadata line for top border of
	  map when map grid border is displayed.

2006-02-02 07:10  we7u

	* src/util.c: A fix for the missing UTM grids with gcc-4.x problem.

2006-02-02 07:10  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing one debug output line.

2006-02-01 08:42  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Patching the search list for Berkely DB library by
	  adding 4.3 and 4.4 search paths.

2006-02-01 08:24  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c: Added border labels for latitude and longitude grid.

2006-01-31 10:32  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c: More tuning of labeled border for UTM grid.  Added
	  Zone number and letter in all four corners when two zones are
	  shown.  All text in border changed to black with border color
	  outline.  For two zones, northings for one zone appear on the
	  left side of the screen northings for the other on the right.
	  The left zone is labeled in black, the right zone labeled in
	  blue.  Minor fixes to turn off display of labels where they run
	  off the screen.

2006-01-30 07:31  tvrusso

	* configure.ac, src/maps.c: "roundf", recently used in maps.c, is a
	  newer extension that is not present in systems that still have
	  old C compilers.

	  Insert a check for roundf, and a workaround for systems that
	  don't support it.

2006-01-28 11:21  we7u

	* bootstrap.sh: Fixing the file test syntax to use Bourne syntax
	  instead of Bash.

2006-01-27 20:36  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c: Minor changes and bug fixes to the UTM grid border
	  labeling code.  Includes rounding of the grid labels to correctly
	  label 10,000 m, 1,000m, and 100m grids, not just the 100m grid.

2006-01-27 15:40  chicoreus

	* src/: maps.c, rotated.c: Added code to RotatedTextItem in
	  rotated.c library to handle special case of rotation of text 90
	  degrees counter clockwise.  In this case, text is rotated by
	  directly transposing x and y coordinates, rather than by applying
	  a sine and cosine transformation to rotate the text, something
	  that produces an italic appearance to the rotated text (making it
	  harder to read, especially when printed).  This change is to
	  support more legible text on the labeled UTM grid on the border
	  of the map, especially for producing maps to be printed.

	  Also made minor changes to border label code in maps.c to make
	  quick and dirty improvements to appearance.

2006-01-27 08:30  we7u

	* Davis/bootstrap.sh, LaCrosse/bootstrap.sh: Since the three
	  bootstrap.sh scripts are the same anyway, run the one from one
	  directory up instead so that we don't have to keep rev'ing all
	  three of them when a change is needed.  Like, duh!

2006-01-27 08:14  we7u

	* config/: language-English.sys, language-French.sys,
	  language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Update for future
	  LaCrosse 23xx weather station support.

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-French.sys,
	  language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Added missing
	  "MAPFONT008|Border Labels||" to support user selectable font for
	  drawing labels on the UTM tickmarks on the labled border.

2006-01-23 21:46  we7u

	* src/: maps.c, maps.h: Fixing up some function prototypes to get

	* config/language-English.sys, src/db.c, src/main.c, src/maps.c,
	  src/xa_config.c, src/xastir.h: Drawing fonts with an outline on
	  the border results in text that is very difficult to read on a

	  UTM tickmarks on the labled border.

2006-01-23 12:41  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c: Getting rid of dependencies on cpl_csv.h, which
	  contains a private (not public) interface.

2006-01-23 12:02  we7u

	* src/: main.c, main.h: Testing for old/new kernel based on number
	  of signals available.  We then use this to decide whether to set
	  "OLD_PTHREADS", which enables or disables the SIGUSR1 handler in
	  the code.  Old kernels only has 32 signals, therefore Linux
	  Pthreads used SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 in their implementation.  We
	  use SIGUSR1 for our Snapshot-on-demand function, therefore we
	  must disable this code if we're running older Pthreads on Linux.

2006-01-23 12:00  we7u

	* bootstrap.sh: Fixing a problem in Automake 1.9 (on SuSE 10 at
	  least) where the mkinstalldir script doesn't get copied over by
	  Automake.  We have to copy it over ourselves after we invoke
	  Automake.

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Updated the format a bit.

2006-01-19 09:17  we7u

	* src/db.c: A fix for another killer packet.  This one had to do
	  with a while loop overrunning an ack_string variable.  Changed to
	  xastir_snprintf() functions there and it solved the immediate
	  problem.

2006-01-18 14:40  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c: Commenting out an include because it causes an

	* src/maps.c: Bug fixes in the labeling of utm zones, northing
	  lines, and easting lines when the grid is labeled.  When grid is
	  finely spaced on the screen, only alternate lines are labeled.
	  Grid and zones are labeled correctly and reasonably most of the
	  time when more than one lettered zone row appears on the screen.
	  Still has some problems, but works for most places.

	* src/: main.c, objects.c: Performance tuning: Moved call to

2005-12-20 10:24  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c: In trying to work out what draw_grid is doing, added
	  some documentation to the utm_grid structures.  Added a test
	  inside draw_grid so that the utm grid labeling code is only
	  running for utm_grid.zone elements that contain rows and columns.

2005-12-19 10:18  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c: Minor bugfix and additional comments on code for
	  labeling UTM grid.  Changed format to include leading zeroes for
	  easting and northing.

2005-12-19 09:40  chicoreus

	* README.MAPS: Added brief discussion of gdalinfo and
	  gdal_translate for handling geotiff files that aren't in byte
	  form or contain multiple bands.

2005-12-16 14:13  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c: Added the ability to draw a 1 pixel outline in a

2005-12-16 14:09  chicoreus

	* src/xa_config.c: Making draw_labeled_grid_border persistent
	  between restarts.

2005-12-15 14:10  chicoreus

	* src/: db.c, main.c, main.h, maps.c: First cut at adding a labeled
	  border to the map shown on the screen for printing.  This can be
	  used, for example, to print maps with a labeled UTM grid for a
	  SAR task team showing the area they are to search.  Metadata
	  about the map is displayed in the top border, coordinates of grid
	  lines are displayed on the bottom and right borders (to make it
	  easier for people to correctly read and report UTM coordinates in
	  the form zone easting northing.  The labeled border is displayed
	  when both the grid and the border are enabled.  There are still
	  problems and missing features.  The rotated font on the right
	  border is not the pretty font used on the rest of the border.
	  The border and grid labels are only drawn for a UTM grid, not for
	  a Lat/Lon grid.  Zone designators are not properly displayed when
	  more than one zone is visible on the screen.	When grid lines are
	  closely spaced, the grid labels overlap on the screen.

2005-12-15 10:31  we7u

	* README.win32: Fixing a typo.

2005-12-15 10:24  chicoreus

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: First rough cut at
	  adding a labeled border to a map to allow the printing of
	  arbitrary maps with a labeled grid (that can, for example, be
	  printed and given to SAR task teams).  If the map grid is
	  enabled, and the border is enabled, a white border is drawn as
	  part of the grid and labels for each grid line are added in this
	  border.  Metadata describing the map are also added in the
	  border.  This is a first rough cut with several problems.  It is
	  only implemented for a UTM grid, not for a Lat/Long grid.  The
	  rotated numbers do not use the same clean font as the non-rotated
	  numbers.  The labels in the border are not clearly
	  distinguishable when the grid is tightly spaced on the screen.
	  The zone labels do not work properly when more than one zone is
	  on the screen.  The choice of labeling the bottom border and the
	  right border with the UTM grid line easting and northings is
	  deliberate to help people to correctly read the map and report
	  UTM coordinates in the form: zone easting northing.

2005-12-13 14:11  we7u

2005-12-06 22:41  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Made code more correct by changing alert->title to

	  of alert->title so the real-world effects of this change are
	  little to none.  Tweaked some comments in the area as well.

2005-12-06 19:04  tvrusso

	* config/nwsmzddmmyy.dbfawk: Fix incorrect key generation for
	  mzddmmyy.shp file.

	  The key produced by the dbfawk rule must match the key that comes
	  from the NWS alert.  These will generally be "XX_Zyyy".  The "ID"
	  field of the mzddmmyy.dbf record is of form "XXZyyy", and prior
	  to this commit it was used directly as the key, thereby never
	  matching any alerts.	This fix inserts the _ character after the
	  first to characters of the ID field to produce a usable key.

2005-12-06 13:35  we7u

	* src/: map_WMS.c, map_gdal.c, map_geo.c, map_shp.c, map_tif.c,
	  map_tiger.c: Adding more map interrupt code, to make it
	  easier/faster to interrupt map drawing by panning or zooming.

2005-11-28 12:51  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Adding capability to interrupt map drawing and
	  start over in the inner loops of the GNIS and DOS map drawing
	  functions.  This makes panning or zooming cause an interrupt much
	  quicker while drawing maps, allowing Xastir to restart the redraw
	  process sooner.

2005-11-28 12:43  we7u

	* src/: map_dos.c, map_gnis.c: Adding capability to interrupt map
	  drawing and start over in the inner loops of the GNIS and DOS map
	  drawing functions.  This makes panning or zooming cause an

	  and not keep asking the system for it over and over again.

2005-11-10 06:59  gstueve

	* scripts/fcc-get: Remove the extra CR where ever possible, real OS

	  structure.

2005-11-08 11:15  gstueve

	* src/main.c: We already have a good idea of what time it is inside
	  UpdateTime. It is NOT necessary to always be asking the system
	  what time it is within one function and its support routines.
	  This is not a '25 or 6 to 4' need.

2005-11-08 06:52  gstueve

	* src/: database.h, db.c, main.c: Make packet display logic much

2005-11-08 06:35  gstueve

2005-11-06 16:14  we7u

	* src/util.c: Fixing the remove_trailing_dash_zero() routine.  It

	  activated.

2005-11-02 11:01  we7u

	* src/db.c: Adding some notes about KISS and CRC's.

2005-11-02 07:40  we7u

2005-11-01 13:32  gstueve

	* src/util.c: Go back to whining about dual-band TNC separator.

2005-11-01 11:21  gstueve

2005-11-01 11:18  gstueve

	  WIDEn-m paradigm.

2005-10-26 21:58  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Truncating transmitted posits at the
	  spec-specified length.  Long comments can't make us transmit
	  out-of-spec packets anymore.

2005-10-26 21:52  we7u

	* src/sound.c: Added a missing include that causes a problem on
	  Solaris if missing.

2005-10-26 12:16  we7u

	* src/main.c: Re-enabling the messages to STDERR when SIGHUP is
	  sent to the main process and a restart is occurring.	Add comment
	  about disabling SIGHUP handler in child processes.

2005-10-26 12:14  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Tweaks to assure that the global disables on the
	  Interface menu have the correct effect.

2005-10-26 12:11  we7u

	* src/: hostname.c, macspeech.c, sound.c, x_spider.c: Regressing to
	  default SIGHUP handler in child processes instead of our special
	  restart() signal handler.

2005-10-26 12:07  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Added date stamps and more comments.

2005-10-26 08:46  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing the messages that appear as Xastir shuts
	  down, putting them back under debug_level control in restart().
	  restart() gets called multiple times due to sending SIGHUP to the
	  TCP/UDP servers during shutdown, and the messages were appearing
	  multiple times if those servers were running.

2005-10-25 18:01  we7u

	* src/util.c: Fixing the alert expiration problem.  May need to be
	  checked when we switch out of daylight savings time again.

2005-10-25 13:08  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding an include so that we can use the ComboBox
	  widget.

2005-10-25 13:04  we7u

	* src/main.c: Limiting the selection box for preconfigured object
	  filenames on the Configure->Defaults dialog to three items.

2005-10-25 12:53  we7u

	* src/main.c: Minor cleanups of the predefined object code:  Added
	  a few free's for XmStrings, allocated memory before an
	  XtGetValues call.

2005-10-25 12:25  we7u

	* src/: util.c, util.h: Making rpl_malloc() compile in all cases
	  and put a prototype for it in util.h to get rid of more compiler
	  warnings.  rpl_malloc() only gets used if AC_FUNC_MALLOC detetcs
	  a version of malloc that doesn't return a valid pointer if you
	  try to malloc zero bytes.

	  These changes make it compile ok on FC4.

2005-10-25 08:18  we7u

	* src/util.c: Added some comments.

2005-10-24 20:37  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Added some notes about future directions we
	  could go to make the tests a bit more complete.

2005-10-24 20:36  we7u

	* FAQ: Tweaked the "restart Xastir" paragraph to keep it
	  up-to-date.

2005-10-24 12:29  we7u

	* src/: main.c, main.h: Patch to allow SIGHUP to cause Xastir to
	  restart properly.  This patch also appears to carry along the
	  original command-line parameters and environment to the new task.
	  The xastir.pid file is correct in all cases, and in fact the
	  main process ID doesn't change between restarts.

2005-10-24 12:27  we7u

	* src/macspeech.c: Spawning a separate process for sending the text
	  to the Mac OSX speech subsystem.  We also incorporate a limit of
	  10 processes that can be waiting for the subsystem to be freed
	  up.  If 10 processes are waiting and another speech request is
	  made, the latter is dropped.	No provision is made for the ORDER
	  that the (up to) ten processes get access to the speech subsystem
	  either so the order will most likely get mixed up if you're
	  trying to send speech strings out too fast.

2005-10-24 08:52  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat, src/main.c, src/objects.c, src/objects.h:
	  Another SAR patch from Paul Morris.  Here's what he says:  This
	  one implements a dialog for selecting CAD objects to delete from
	  the Erase All CAD polygon menu item along with implementing
	  delete by name in CAD_object_delete().  It also adds some help
	  text on prepared objects and CAD objects and changes the
	  XmStringCreateLocalized() calls to XmStringCreateLtoR().

2005-10-21 21:46  we7u

	* src/main.c: Restarting on SIGHUP a bit better.  It now sends
	  argv[] at least the first time around.  Need to figure out why
	  the 2nd time doesn't work at all.  Perhaps signal handlers are
	  getting messed up on reboot?

2005-10-21 13:28  we7u

	* src/objects.c: Another tweak by Paul Morris for proper handling
	  of CAD objects.

2005-10-21 12:33  we7u

	* FAQ: Reworded text for SIGHUP.

2005-10-21 12:27  we7u

	* FAQ: Adding the SIGHUP stuff to the FAQ.

2005-10-21 12:18  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started: Added some more signals to the External
	  Stimuli section.

2005-10-21 12:11  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding support for SIGHUP.  Xastir will
	  save/exit/restart if a SIGHUP is received.  Also enabled a
	  #define near the top of main.c that enables the xastir.pid
	  processing.  If someone attempts to start Xastir and there's a
	  process running with that PID, Xastir will exit.

	  The SIGHUP support works, but the command-line parameters aren't
	  carried through as the normal processing for them devours them
	  out of the argv[] array.  We need to save that array away or use
	  a non-destructive method of processing the parameters.

2005-10-21 11:02  we7u

	* src/objects.c: Small tweak so that the code looks in the
	  /usr/local/share/xastir/config directory for the predefined
	  objects for now.  Later we'll add the capability of overriding
	  the system files with local user files.

2005-10-21 10:41  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Reordering the management & positioning
	  statements so that it doesn't appear on the screen until it gets
	  positioned.

2005-10-21 07:27  tvrusso

	* src/: main.c, objects.c: Move variable declarations to tops of
	  blocks to satisfy old-fashioned compilers that hate the modern
	  practice of declaring variables just before their use.

2005-10-20 15:47  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Changing
	  pre-defined objects labels to more descriptive words.

2005-10-20 15:02  we7u

	* src/main.c: Getting rid of Button1 assignment for CAD objects.
	  This prevents us from zooming/panning/measuring while creating a
	  CAD object.

2005-10-20 14:52  we7u

	* config/Makefile.am: Adding predefined files to Makefile so
	  they'll get installed.

2005-10-20 14:52  we7u

	* config/: predefined_EVENT.sys, predefined_SAR.sys: Example
	  pre-defined SAR/Event object files by Paul Morris.

	  src/database.h, src/main.c, src/main.h, src/objects.c,
	  src/objects.h, src/xa_config.c: Patch by Paul Morris, AA3SD, to
	  tweak CAD objects functionality a bit and add pre-defined
	  SAR/Event objects from files.

2005-10-20 13:34  we7u

	* src/color.c: Reformatting.  No real code changes.

2005-10-20 13:12  gstueve

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h, wx_gui.c: Reintroduce SKYWARN addendum to

	* src/: map_WMS.c, map_geo.c, map_tif.c, map_tiger.c: Commenting
	  out the XFreeColors() calls for now.	Cygwin seems to be much
	  more sensitive to these calls than Linux.

2005-10-19 13:24  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Disabling sending of my own posits to x_spider
	  if transmit_disable is non-zero.

2005-10-19 13:19  we7u

	  disabled globally.

2005-10-19 12:21  we7u

	* src/: map_WMS.c, map_geo.c, map_tif.c, map_tiger.c: Adding
	  XFreeColors() calls just before each XAllocColor() call.  This is
	  to keep the counters in sync that count how many times each color
	  is allocated, hopefully preventing the can't allocate color
	  warning messages.

2005-10-19 12:20  we7u

2005-10-17 11:47  we7u

	* INSTALL: Tweaking formatting of -l language notes.

2005-10-16 10:16  we7u

	* config/language-German.sys: An update to the German language file
	  by Rolf Bleher, DK7IN.  Thanks!

2005-10-15 18:51  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys: Updates by Han Sytsma.  Thanks!

2005-10-15 18:50  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys: Fixing a typo.

2005-10-15 10:30  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c: Making sure the projects.h include isn't needed
	  unless libgdal is compiled in as well.  Got rid of UV define and
	  changed invocation to "projUV" instead.

2005-10-15 09:42  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c: Fixing a problem caused by the new code which
	  fixes the gdal/geotiff bug.  This fix cuases the original
	  functions to be called if gdal isn't installed.

2005-10-14 11:06  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c: Received permission from Frank Warmerdam to use
	  some of his code inside Xastir, relicensing it under GPL.  We use
	  this new right to include one function in map_tif.c which allows
	  us to keep topo maps support even when libgdal is compiled in.

2005-10-14 08:11  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a note about running configure from an xterm
	  so that "gv" support will be compiled in.  If run from a non-X11
	  window, "gv" configure test fails.

2005-10-13 13:51  francais1

	* config/language-French.sys: Some more strings translated, but not
	  all...

2005-10-13 08:39  gstueve

	* src/main.c: Put the full title back on the window, so we can know
	  what machine is running the app.

2005-10-12 17:09  we7u

	* src/messages.c: Added code that will switch back to RF if no
	  TX-enabled INET interfaces are up.

2005-10-12 13:09  we7u

	* src/messages.c: New message routing which should take care of a
	  bug-list item: Ceasing to transmit when messaging with internet
	  station and internet interfaces go down.  Problem remaining with
	  this code:  We transmit out RF interfaces even if QSO'ing with
	  station over internet interface.

2005-10-12 11:33  we7u

	* src/: locate_gui.c, main.c, messages_gui.c, track_gui.c, util.c,
	  util.h: Fixing all of the callsign entry fields so that "-0" is
	  truncated from the end of the string when used.

2005-10-11 16:52  we7u

	* src/main.c: Tweaks to convert callsign-0 to callsign for
	  configure station dialog.

2005-10-11 10:12  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added a bit of debugging.  No effect for normal
	  operation.

2005-10-11 08:16  we7u

	* src/db.c: Slightly better igating of messages.  This versions
	  saves the message+acks away and then uses that exact string again
	  when igating it, instead of putting together the bits and pieces
	  at that point like the previous code.

2005-10-10 22:07  we7u

	* src/db.c: Another tweak to get reply-ack's propagated through an
	  Xastir igate to RF.  This one is tested and works.

2005-10-10 18:29  we7u

	* src/db.c: Comment changes.  Also changed the fprintf() for REJ
	  packets to only dump text to STDERR if the REJ was sent to
	  my_callsign.

2005-10-10 12:11  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changed one comment.

2005-10-10 11:52  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added comments.  fprintf() to stderr when we receive a
	  REJ packet. We can receive those when a Kenwood radio's message
	  buffer is full.

2005-10-10 11:48  we7u

	* src/messages.c: Minor tweaks w.r.t. REPLY-ACK protocol.  Making
	  sure we strip off the unneeded portion before we check the ACK.

2005-10-10 09:31  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing igating of messages to RF for messages with
	  REPLY-ACK protocol at the end.  We were originally sending our
	  processed ACK at the end which knocked off the free-ack portion.
	  Now we send the full five-character unprocessed REPLY-ACK.

2005-10-10 09:29  we7u

	* src/igate.c: Adding some comments.

2005-10-10 08:23  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing a couple of compiler problems via casting.
	  Problems were not seen with SuSE compiler but were seen on other
	  systems.

2005-10-07 18:16  we7u

	* src/objects.c: Tweaks to avoid other object/item/station names
	  when creating SAR objects.  Xastir will now add a number to the
	  end of the typical name (starting at "2") in order to create a
	  unique name.	This makes for extremely fast placement of
	  important mission objects without worrying about old mission
	  objects or conflicting with other people's current missions.

2005-10-07 18:13  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added some comments.

2005-10-07 18:10  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added some comments.

2005-10-07 18:07  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c: Added a comment.

2005-10-07 18:05  we7u

	* src/list_gui.c: Added some comments.

2005-10-07 13:16  we7u

	* src/objects.c: Added some comments.

2005-10-07 12:49  we7u

	* src/objects.c: Adding fprintf() statements to help work on the
	  SAR objects code.

2005-10-07 12:26  we7u

	* src/: main.c, xa_config.c, xastir.h: Checking in some work having
	  to do with saving/restoring X/Y offsets for the main window.	The
	  code doesn't work yet so it commented out.

2005-10-07 12:25  we7u

	* src/objects.c: Adding some comments about future coding that
	  needs to be done w.r.t. SAR objects.

2005-10-07 11:16  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: Another minor tweak for the icon.

2005-10-07 11:15  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: Adding the icon.xbm file into the Makefiles.

2005-10-06 13:50  tvrusso

	* src/: main.c, objects.c: Move declarations of variables to before
	  first executable lines of code, to satisfy old-fashioned
	  compilers (gcc 2.95, etc.)

2005-10-06 13:45  we7u

	* src/icon.xbm: Someone pointed out that the RF radiation wasn't
	  symmetrical.	Now it is.

2005-10-06 12:46  we7u

	* src/objects.c: Commenting out a debug statement.

2005-10-06 12:39  we7u

	* src/: main.c, objects.c, objects.h: Commenting out the wm_hints
	  code.  Adding a "Create SAR Objects" entry to the mouse menu.
	  That last was written and contributed by Paul J.  Morris, aa3sd.
	  Thanks!

2005-10-06 12:37  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Adding "Create SAR
	  Objects" right-click mouse menu.

2005-10-06 12:19  we7u

	* src/icon.xbm: Added radio transmissions emanating from the
	  antenna.

2005-10-05 23:47  we7u

	* src/: icon.xbm, main.c: Separating out the icon into its own
	  file.

2005-10-05 22:49  we7u

	* src/main.c: Casting to type "Dimension" is not proper for
	  parameters passed to XtSetArg().  Have changed to variables of
	  that type for parameter passing.  Also cleaned up the -geometry
	  code a bit.  The windows are now sized properly per the
	  command-line parameters.

2005-10-05 17:25  we7u

	* src/main.c: A better version of the -geometry code that is
	  starting to work on Cygwin.  The size is larger than specified,
	  perhaps because it is based on char sizes instead of pixels?
	  Anyway, this part of the code is starting to work.

2005-10-05 11:37  we7u

	* src/main.c: Rearranging things.  No code changes.

2005-10-05 08:34  we7u

	* src/main.c: Another attempt at the -geometry stuff.  Here we only
	  use size_hints in one case, plus we lock down the minWidth and
	  minHeight of the main widget when we create it (to the size we
	  want it to appear as), but change those parameters before we map
	  the window to the screen.  This method was borrowed from the
	  Lincity project where they do similar things.  As usual, this
	  stuff works for me on Linux/FVWM2.

2005-10-04 12:12  we7u

	* src/: main.c, xa_config.c: Another shot at this -geometry stuff.
	  Moved the size_hints stuff after the window is mapped.  Added an
	  icon.

2005-10-04 09:11  we7u

	* src/main.c: Reducing the number of size_hints variables I'm
	  setting.  Changing XtPopup() to XMapWindow() for appshell.

2005-10-03 13:13  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Tweaking SCREEN_ZOOM to match new
	  highest-allowed value for zoom level.

2005-10-03 13:11  we7u

	* src/main.c: Allow a higher zoom level for entire world, for
	  rather small map windows.

2005-10-03 13:05  we7u

	* src/main.c: Attempting to recenter view when zooming out all the
	  way.	Doesn't quite work yet.

2005-10-03 12:56  we7u

	* src/main.c: Getting rid of the X-dimension checks in
	  check_range() in order to make it easier to play at the +/-180
	  boundaries.

2005-10-03 12:51  we7u

	* src/main.c: A slightly better system for controlling left/right
	  edges of map when at left/right edge of world.  check_range().

2005-10-03 11:34  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixes for -geometry support and main window
	  save/restore support.

2005-10-03 11:33  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Changing the minimum size that can be restored
	  to for Xastir's main window.

2005-10-02 12:27  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding window manager hints back in.

2005-10-01 23:26  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.c, geocoder_gui.c, interface_gui.c,
	  list_gui.c, locate_gui.c, maps.c, xastir.h, bulletin_gui.c,
	  main.c, messages_gui.c, objects.c, popup_gui.c, track_gui.c,
	  view_message_gui.c, wx_gui.c: Getting rid of the Global.top
	  widget which was unmapped.  Making appshell be the top level
	  widget.  Added parsing for the -geometry command-line variable
	  via XParseGeometry() so that we can tell when either the
	  height/width or the x/y offsets have been specified.	We then set
	  up appshell based on that info or using the config file data if
	  it wasn't specified on the command-line.

2005-10-01 17:46  we7u

	* src/main.c: Commenting out the 100x100 minimum window size
	  parameters.

2005-09-30 13:16  we7u

	* src/main.c: Commenting out the code which sets
	  min_width/min_height in the XSizeHints struct.

2005-09-30 11:25  we7u

	* src/main.c: Commenting out base_width and base_height parameters
	  as they override the min_width/min_height parameters if
	  specified.  We only need one set.

2005-09-30 11:02  we7u

	* src/main.c: Another shot at the XSizeHints stuff (-geometry).
	  Learning a bit more with each iteration.

2005-09-30 08:58  we7u

	* src/main.c: Of course some of those I commented out previously
	  appear to matter, so here they are, enabled in the code again.

2005-09-30 08:51  we7u

	* src/main.c: Getting rid of a few unused variables.  Commenting
	  out sections in the geometry setting portions that appear to have
	  no effect.

2005-09-30 07:44  tvrusso

	* DEBUG_LEVELS: Change statement that the highest debug level is
	  2047 to 4095.  There is now a debug level of 2048 (ALOHA
	  calculation and multipoint object debugging).

2005-09-30 07:27  we7u

	* INSTALL, help/help-English.dat: Updating the docs regarding TCP
	  and UDP server ports.

2005-09-30 07:01  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changed PSize flag to USSize to indicate that the
	  user had specified the size of the window in that one case.  This
	  gives it a higher priority.

2005-09-30 06:46  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Updating the xastir_udp_client
	  description.

2005-09-30 05:26  we7u

	* src/db.c: Telemetry fix which adds it as status to the station
	  record, submitted by Andrew Rich, vk4tec.  Thanks!

2005-09-30 02:50  we7u

	* src/main.c: Took another look at the XSizeHints struct.  Might
	  work better now to provide proper geometry hints to window
	  managers.

2005-09-29 12:19  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c: Casting to the correct type for X11 calls.

2005-09-29 12:19  we7u

	* src/: db.c, location.c, main.c, map_WMS.c, map_dos.c, map_geo.c,
	  map_gnis.c, map_pdb.c, map_shp.c, map_tiger.c, maps.c, objects.c,
	  popup_gui.c: Casting to the correct type in X11 calls.  Adding
	  more debug output to create_appshell() for -geometry stuff.

2005-09-29 11:00  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Fix by	Thorsten Lockert.  Fixes a problem on
	  MacOSX where -lgdal can have revision numbers after it.  Without
	  this fix the test compile using gdal fails.

2005-09-29 08:42  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added more debugging output for -geometry.

2005-09-29 07:59  we7u

	* src/main.c: Moving some variable declarations to the correct
	  spot.  Ended up originally putting them after a bit of functional
	  code, but they must be at the start of a block for many
	  compilers.

2005-09-29 07:37  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing to 3rd-party packets for packets sent from
	  UDP to the RF ports.

2005-09-28 13:21  we7u

	* src/main.c: Commenting out some unused variables.

2005-09-28 13:02  we7u

	* src/main.c: More mods for UDP->RF.  This version may be working
	  but it needs testing on a system with real RF interfaces to see
	  if it behaves properly.

2005-09-28 09:24  we7u

	* src/: main.c, x_spider.c, x_spider.h: Continuing work on support
	  for UDP server port.	We're getting closer now to supporting
	  sending of packets to RF.

2005-09-28 09:22  we7u

	* src/xastir_udp_client.c: Changed the help text.

2005-09-28 09:03  we7u

	* symbols/symbols.dat: Adding the /F, Farm Equipment, symbol, as a
	  green tractor.  Also added hash mark delimiters between each
	  symbol definition.

2005-09-28 07:50  we7u

	* config/language-German.sys: Updates by Andreas Bier, dl1hrc.
	  Thanks!

2005-09-27 08:16  we7u

	* src/main.c: Simplifying startup of the application in main().
	  Changing to XtVaOpenApplication, which supersedes the function
	  call we were using before, and removing some explicit function
	  calls that are handled automatically by both the old and the new
	  function call (unnecessary code).  These changes are being made
	  to implement proper support for the "-geometry" command-line
	  flag.

2005-09-25 19:35  we7u

	* src/: alert.h, database.h, db.c, draw_symbols.c, geocoder_gui.c,
	  interface.c, main.h, maps.h, track_gui.c, util.h, Makefile.am,
	  main.c, maps.c, util.c: Moving the Object/Item/Cad_Object code
	  into objects.h and objects.c.

2005-09-25 19:26  we7u

	* src/: objects.c, objects.h: Moving nearly all of the
	  Object/Item/CAD Object code into one header and one source file.
	  This makes main.c quite a bit smaller.

2005-09-24 11:21  we7u

	* src/main.c: Proper numeric checks for Global.top size/offsets,
	  for deciding whether to make the 2nd Xastir window (the first
	  visible window) copy either set of parameters.

2005-09-24 11:00  we7u

	* src/: list_gui.c, main.c: Changing variables used in
	  XtVaGetValues() calls to "Dimension" or "Position".  Adding an
	  out-of-range check for dimension for the case where we're
	  attempting to discover whether the first window has had -geometry
	  specified.

2005-09-23 17:18  we7u

	* src/main.c: First working version of the "-geometry" command-line
	  flag.  Will hopefully know soon if it works on all platforms we
	  support.  Let the testing begin!

2005-09-23 12:01  we7u

	* src/main.c: "-geometry" switch now works for sizing the
	  application (instead of "-g"), but the X/Y offsets still don't
	  work.

2005-09-22 19:18  tvrusso

	* src/main.c: Give "appshell_width" and "appshell_height" initial
	  values of 0.	This allows the contents of the xastir.cnf file's
	  SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT to be used if no geometry is
	  specified in -g.  As it was, if one didn't give -g then these two
	  settings in the config file were ignored and a 100x100 window
	  appeared on every start-up.

2005-09-22 13:32  we7u

	* src/main.c: A fix for Xastir hanging if the -g flag is used but
	  only offsets are specified.

2005-09-22 13:07  we7u

	* src/main.c: Initial implementation of the "-g" geometry
	  command-line flag.  It supports sizing the application, but
	  doesn't support X/Y offsets yet.  That's in the works though.

2005-09-21 22:29  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/main.c, src/main.h,
	  src/track_gui.c: Added success/failure popups to findu trail
	  download.  Changed max_trail_colors to a define instead of an
	  int.	Added a Change Trail Color button to the Station Info
	  dialog.

2005-09-21 11:51  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/track_gui.c: Popping up an error
	  if the new backgrounded fetch findu trail fails.  Changing
	  variables that the thread depends on to "static" so they'll be
	  around when the thread needs them.

2005-09-20 17:35  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Restructure test for gv slightly, so that
	  AC_PATH_PROG is called first, and version is tested if gv is
	  found.  The case where gv is found, but `gv -v | cut -d ' ' -f 1`
	  not being "gv" is in fact a sign of error that needs to be
	  reported in a meaningful way.

	  Turns out that when I do my normal cygwin build (which is usually
	  done in a non-X cygwin run to save memory), the old way of
	  probing gv found the gv executable, but because "gv -v" tries to
	  connect to the X server and reports failure if it can't,
	  configure was telling me that gv was found, but the build would
	  actually happen without gv.  This was quite confusing.

	  With the new test as committed here, I still can't build with gv
	  outside of an xterm on cygwin, but the reason actually shows up
	  in the configure output.

2005-09-17 11:33  we7u

	* src/lang.h: Bumping up the size of the language buffer as we're
	  bumping up against the limits now for some languages.

2005-09-16 16:46  we7u

	* src/xastir_udp_client.c: Changing some comments and the usage
	  text.

2005-09-16 16:45  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c: Trying to protect the track download so that
	  only one can be done at once.  Not perfect yet as sometimes the
	  GUI locks up.  More to do.

2005-09-16 16:34  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys: Changing "New Call" to "New Station"
	  for the speech strings.  I think it sounds better.

2005-09-16 14:09  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys: Adding an 's' to the end of "Enable
	  Server Ports".

2005-09-16 14:09  we7u

	* config/language-German.sys: Updates courtesy of Andreas Bier,
	  dl1hrc.  Thanks!

2005-09-16 13:18  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Tweaking the text regarding the UDP
	  server/client.  Adding more about the -identify command-line
	  flag.

2005-09-16 13:14  we7u

	* src/xastir_udp_client.c: Making the output from the -identify
	  response go to STDOUT instead of STDERR.  Only makes sense so it
	  can be piped more easily into scripts and such.

2005-09-16 13:09  we7u

	* src/xastir_udp_client.c: Implemented the "-identify" command-line
	  flag.  The "message" portion must have at least a single char in
	  order for the identify query to be sent to the server.

2005-09-16 12:37  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat, src/x_spider.c: Now we send UDP packets
	  out the x_spider TCP ports as well, if the packet is
	  authenticated properly.

2005-09-16 12:26  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Adding a "-identify" option to the UDP server.
	  It returns a UDP packet containing the callsign.

2005-09-16 11:48  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c: Putting the fetch_findu_trail function into a
	  separate background thread.

2005-09-16 11:48  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Adding text about the UDP server feature
	  and the xastir_udp_client.

2005-09-16 07:38  we7u

	* src/: x_spider.h, xastir_udp_client.c: Moving the default port
	  for UDP from 2024 to 2023, as TCP and UDP can co-exist on the
	  same port number.

2005-09-15 16:59  we7u

	* src/xastir_udp_client.c: Fixed the hostname lookup.  You can now
	  specify any hostname and port.

2005-09-15 12:38  we7u

	* src/util.c: Adding the long integer time at the beginning of the
	  timestamp line for the log files.  Makes sorting easy.

2005-09-15 11:56  we7u

	* src/: util.c, wx.c: Changing timestamping to add a timestamp line
	  per packet instead of once per 30 seconds.

2005-09-15 11:47  we7u

	* src/: x_spider.c, xastir_udp_client.c: Adding authentication to
	  the UDP packets.

2005-09-15 11:45  we7u

	* src/db.c: Allowing user-defined and telemetry packets to be
	  gated.

2005-09-15 07:54  we7u

	* src/.cvsignore: Adding xastir_udp_client to the ignore list.

2005-09-15 07:52  we7u

	* src/: Makefile.am, x_spider.c: Renaming the UDP client from
	  udp_client to xastir_udp_client.

2005-09-15 07:51  we7u

	* src/xastir_udp_client.c: Renaming this file from udp_client.c to
	  xastir_udp_client.c, to avoid similar names for UDP clients.

2005-09-15 07:50  we7u

	* src/udp_client.c: Renaming this file to xastir_udp_client.c

2005-09-14 21:53  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, main.c, x_spider.c, x_spider.h: Adding a UDP
	  server at port 2024.

2005-09-14 21:45  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: Adding the udp client.

2005-09-14 21:44  we7u

	* src/udp_client.c: Initial checkin of a UDP client.  Currently
	  this is hard-coded to talk to the localhost address, but that can
	  be fixed later.  It also hangs currently if the server isn't
	  responding.

2005-09-09 13:08  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing a typo in one of the new langcode() string
	  callouts.

2005-09-09 12:20  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c, util.c: Replacing a bunch of hard-coded
	  strings with langcode() strings.

2005-09-09 12:19  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Adding more
	  language strings to replace hard-coded strings.

2005-09-08 21:46  we7u

	* src/: draw_symbols.c, fcc_data.c, geocoder_gui.c, map_cache.c,
	  rac_data.c, view_message_gui.c, xa_config.c: Adding language
	  strings for previously hard-coded values.  Changed get_long and
	  get_int functions in xa_config.c to give better output when
	  variables are missing or out-of-range in the config file upon
	  Xastir startup.

2005-09-08 21:40  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Adding more
	  language strings for previously hard-coded English values.

2005-09-08 09:49  we7u

	* INSTALL: Adding a blurb about conflicts between GDAL internal
	  libraries and external libraries that Xastir can use.

2005-09-08 09:39  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Move -lgdal to end of LIBS line if it's found.

	  It is possible for gdal to be using its own internal geotiff
	  library, and this can interfere with use of an external one in
	  xastir.  Having it later in the line than geotiff can fix that.

	  This could cause problems for systems with busted linkers that
	  need gdal to be earlier than everything it depends on.  If that
	  happens, it might be necessary to add the contents of
	  "gdal-config --dep-libs" to LIBS after -lgdal.

2005-09-08 08:58  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c: Commenting out some unnecessary includes.  Adding
	  some error messages when function calls fail.  Minor reformatting
	  w.r.t.  braces to match the Xastir project standard.

2005-09-07 12:30  we7u

	* src/main.c: Assuring that the "System time jumped backwards 1
	  seconds!" message doesn't say "0 seconds!", as I've seen recently
	  due to the way the code was originally written.

2005-09-02 18:42  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: More appropriate output for the case where gv is
	  not found by configure.

2005-09-02 16:00  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Adding a clause for the case where no usable "gv"
	  is found.

2005-09-02 15:34  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Another stab at trying to do the "gv" revision
	  tests.

2005-09-02 15:34  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Pop up warning messages if we try to print but don't
	  have the proper support compiled in.

2005-09-02 13:54  we7u

	* acinclude.m4, src/maps.c: Tweaks to hopefully determine
	  automatically which version of "gv" is being used and change the
	  code to correspond to the proper API.

2005-09-02 12:30  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Preparing for configure.ac tests that will determine
	  the "gv" version, then we can change how we call up "gv" based on
	  that.

2005-09-02 08:47  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Changing to a <CR><LF> combination for the
	  "Hello" server message, per the APRS INET conventions.

2005-09-01 10:00  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started: Modified the note regarding geocode
	  files.

2005-09-01 08:08  we7u

	* configure.ac, src/main.c: Adding a test for sigignore() to
	  configure.ac, and code to use it in main.c.  We were getting a
	  warning under Solaris by using signal() with SIG_IGN as the
	  parameter.

2005-09-01 07:43  we7u

	* src/util.c: Adding strings.h include.  Need for Solaris.

2005-08-31 21:16  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.kpc3: Removing "exp on" from the file.  I
	  guess SOMEBODY doesn't think we need AEA commands in a KANTRONICS
	  config file.	The nerve!

2005-08-31 14:42  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Blowing away the autom4te.cache directory at
	  the start of each run, to make sure that we start out
	  ultra-clean.

2005-08-31 09:59  we7u

	* configure.ac: Attempt to remove "-no-unused" from linking stage
	  for Cygwin builds, as GCC links to complain about that flag
	  during linking.

2005-08-30 14:19  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Changing grep syntax so that it will work with
	  non-GNU grep (Solaris).  Getting rid of dash near the end.

2005-08-30 13:52  we7u

	* src/: awk.c, bulletin_gui.c, db.c, main.c, map_WMS.c, map_dos.c,
	  map_gdal.c, map_geo.c, map_gnis.c, map_pdb.c, map_shp.c,
	  map_tif.c, map_tiger.c, maps.c: Mucking about with the strings.h
	  includes.

2005-08-30 13:28  kd6zwr

	* src/: awk.c, geo-find.c, io-common.c, map_gnis.c: protecting the
	  strings.h with an ifdef, and casting isspace() family of macros
	  to match man page (int).

2005-08-30 12:41  we7u

	* src/awk.c: Adding a strings.h include for Solaris support.

2005-08-30 11:33  we7u

	* src/db.c: Displaying the raw packet in a dialog for the case
	  where we detect "EMERGENCY" in the comment field or one of the
	  emergency-type destination callsigns in a packet.

2005-08-30 11:31  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.paccomm: Commenting out a "WIDE" alias that
	  remained.  Changed it to "LOCAL" also.

2005-08-30 11:31  we7u

	* src/locate_gui.c: Skipping the dialog destroy call if you hit the
	  FCC/RAC lookup or the Locate button.	The dialog now has to be
	  manually cleared by hitting the Cancel button.

2005-08-29 08:06  we7u

	* src/: db.c, interface.c, wx.c: Fixing warnings seen on OSX 10.4.
	  Very minor "signedness" warnings in string functions.

2005-08-27 17:21  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Tweaking a patch provided by James Washer that
	  will send a string out the server port on each connect.  My
	  chances were merely to the format of the string.  Thanks go to
	  James for the patch itself.

2005-08-26 14:12  tvrusso

	* configure.ac, src/hostname.c: Fix so that hostname.c can compile
	  on systems that define neither sighandler_t nor sig_t.  This is
	  necessary because of the new cast to sighandler_t of the second
	  argument of signal() that was put there to shut gcc warnings up.

2005-08-25 14:29  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Getting rid of some extra restores of variables
	  that I shouldn't have added last go-around.

2005-08-25 13:48  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Summary text and summary.log were incorrect if gdal
	  wasn't found.  Fixed.

2005-08-25 08:11  we7u

	* src/db.c: Commenting out some debug code.

2005-08-24 21:27  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Simplifying the get_long() and get_int() code
	  per discussions with Tom Russo.  Also attempting to get rid of
	  some compiler warnings that we see with FreeBSD.

2005-08-24 10:58  we7u

	* src/main.c: Switching the state of trap_segfault variable to make
	  more sense.

2005-08-24 09:50  we7u

	* src/main.c: Change in text suggested by James Washer.  Also added
	  the -t option to the command-flag help text.

2005-08-24 09:07  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Removing some ill-advised casts to time_t's.
	  Was trying to get rid of warnings that appear on FreeBSD, but
	  this was the wrong approach and didn't fix the problem.

2005-08-23 21:08  tvrusso

	* configure.ac, src/hostname.c: Change logic for deciding when to
	  use a sigjmp_buf vs. a jmp_buf.

	  The code that was originally here would only work if sigjmp_buf
	  was a #define, but on some systems it's a typedef.  The new code
	  works for both.

2005-08-23 19:53  we7u

	* src/: awk.c, bulletin_gui.c, map_gdal.c, maps.c: Fixing up
	  function headers to be ANSI-C compliant.

2005-08-23 16:25  we7u

	* INSTALL: Tweaking the GDAL install instructions a bit more.

2005-08-23 16:04  we7u

	* INSTALL: Updating the GDAL install instructions.

2005-08-23 14:38  we7u

	* configure.ac: Changing the summary format slightly.  No code
	  changes.

2005-08-23 14:23  we7u

	* configure.ac: Drawing a line in the configure summary between the
	  normal and the more unusual parameters.

2005-08-23 14:18  we7u

	* configure.ac: Changing some text on the summary output.  No code
	  changes.

2005-08-23 13:52  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Add configure-time check for usability of
	  -Wno-unused-parameter. Older compilers (not newer as was
	  indicated in the comments) don't like that and need -Wno-unused
	  instead.

	  Return -W to the CFLAGS, and use whatever -Wno-unused* works.

2005-08-23 12:39  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added a new time_t variable that we can use to
	  call ctime() with, in order to avoid a compiler warning.

2005-08-23 12:38  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Changing a bunch of pointer casts from "long *"
	  to "time_t *" to avoid compiler warnings.

2005-08-23 12:36  we7u

	* src/util.c: Casting some time_t's to long's to avoid compiler
	  warnings.

2005-08-23 12:35  we7u

	* src/main.c: Casting a time_t to an unsigned long to remove a
	  compiler warning.  Fixing up a function header to make it ANSI-C
	  compliant.

2005-08-23 12:32  we7u

	* src/db.c: Casting some time_t's to long's to get rid of warnings.

2005-08-23 12:32  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Casting some time_t's to unsigned long's to get rid
	  of warnings.

2005-08-23 12:30  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Taking some of the new compiler flags back out as
	  one of them isn't recognized on some versions of GCC, and the
	  other causes too many warnings without it.  Hopefully we can add
	  the "-W" back in at a later date once we figure out how to get
	  rid of the "unused parameter" warnings on a case-by-case basis.

2005-08-22 16:02  we7u

	* src/io-mmap.c: Cleaning up compiler warnings.

2005-08-22 15:21  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Adding "-W" and "-Wno-unused_parameter" compiler
	  flags.  Still a clean compile with SuSE Linux 9.0.  No errors, no
	  warnings.

2005-08-22 11:45  we7u

	* src/: db.c, interface.c, interface.h: Added is_local_interface()
	  and is_network_interface() functions.  Changed packet_data_add()
	  to use them, and to changes it functionality so that packets
	  transmitted to local interfaces would be visible in the incoming
	  data dialog.

2005-08-22 11:37  we7u

	* src/: shp_hash.c, shp_hash.h: Fixing up prototypes and function
	  headers so that they are ANSI-C compatible.

2005-08-22 11:36  we7u

	* src/rtree/: card.c, gammavol.c, index.c, index.h, node.c, rect.c:
	  Fixing up prototypes and function headers so they are ANSI-C
	  compatible.

2005-08-22 11:35  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Tweaking to match new format for summary.log
	  file (we only want to show the first line now).

2005-08-19 18:53  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, map_cache.c, map_cache.h, map_shp.c,
	  maps.c, testawk.c: Fixing up function and prototype definitions
	  so they are ansi-C standard and will pass the new compiler tests
	  that were just added.

2005-08-19 18:40  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Adding more strict compiler checking.

2005-08-19 18:27  we7u

2005-08-19 14:26  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Real fix for memory leak in the font metrics
	  code.  Don't know why we need a '1' parameter for this system
	  call, but with a '0' we end up with a leak.

2005-08-19 13:32  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Fix for big memory leak.

2005-08-19 11:33  tvrusso

	* configure.ac, src/hostname.c: Add probe for sighandler_t
	  definition, and code to work around it being missing.

2005-08-18 16:54  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Fooled myself.  Last fixes weren't fixes but
	  stopped the compile.	Will rework that fix later.

2005-08-18 16:51  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Putting a few casts in to get rid of "-pedantic"
	  warnings.

2005-08-18 16:21  we7u

	* src/map_cache.c: Getting rid of three more "-pedantic" warnings.

2005-08-18 16:09  we7u

	* src/interface.c: More tweaks so that the "-pedantic" compiler
	  flag will show fewer warnings.

2005-08-18 15:56  we7u

	* src/: hostname.c, shp_hash.c: Fixing up minor warnings that the
	  "-pedantic" compiler flag revealed.

2005-08-18 15:27  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, db.c: Getting rid of another couple of warnings
	  that the "-pedantic" compiler flag revealed.	Very minor stuff.

2005-08-18 15:11  we7u

	* src/hashtable_private.h: Removing the semicolon at the end of a
	  function that "-pedantic" compiler flag caught.

2005-08-18 14:49  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4, src/testawk.c: Make use of LIBS in the gdal probe
	  without gdal-config match the usage with gdal-config

	  fix bogon in awk_rule table in testawk.c

2005-08-18 14:43  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Casting to an "int" in order to get around a
	  compiler warning that we get if we turn on stricter checking.

2005-08-18 14:42  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding a missing initializer.

2005-08-18 14:00  we7u

	* src/: leak_detection.h, util.h: Tweaks by Tom Russo to make the
	  new include arrangement work on FreeBSD.  Evidently I broke that
	  platform with my most recent include file changes.

2005-08-18 08:28  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c: Moving the dmalloc code to a separate
	  header file.

2005-08-18 08:27  we7u

	* src/util.c: Messing with the hash iterator free's again.  Moving
	  dmalloc code to a separate header file.

2005-08-18 08:26  we7u

	* src/: map_gdal.c, maps.c, wx_gui.c: Messing with the hash
	  iterator free's again.

2005-08-18 08:26  we7u

	* src/leak_detection.h: Here's where the malloc and dmalloc code
	  was moved to.  The order in which this is done with respect to
	  the libgc code is critical, therefore it has all been moved to
	  this one header file so the order can be closely guarded.

2005-08-18 08:24  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Removing the dmalloc code.

2005-08-18 08:23  we7u

	* src/db.c: Removing dmalloc ifdef's.

2005-08-18 08:21  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Getting rid of dmalloc ifdef's.	We use libgc to do
	  similar things.  Messing with the iterator ifdef's again.

2005-08-17 13:16  we7u

	* src/util.c: Skipping the free() of the hashtable iterator in all
	  cases.

2005-08-17 13:13  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Moving alert-related code to debug level 2.  Skipping
	  hash iterator free() calls for now as they cause segfaults if
	  libgc is compiled in.

2005-08-17 13:11  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing debug_level to 2 for wx_alert-related code.

2005-08-17 12:04  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: Adding the leak_detector.h file.

2005-08-17 12:02  we7u

	* src/leak_detection.h: Moving the LIBGC defines/includes into a
	  new header file.  The order in which these are used in a C module
	  is important, as is the order that the thread includes are done.
	  This will help assure that the order remains consistent so that
	  the memory leak detection will work.

2005-08-17 11:59  we7u

	* INSTALL: Tweaking the libgc instructions.

2005-08-15 17:47  we7u

	* src/util.c: Separating out the pointers so we can better keep

2005-08-15 17:42  we7u

	* src/main.c: Making the RINO download timeout slider always
	  visible in the timing dialog, but insensitive if gpsman is not
	  compiled in.

2005-08-15 13:01  we7u

	* configure.ac: Adding a very short summary of the configure tests
	  and results to summary.log.  This should aid in debugging as we
	  can more quickly see what passed/failed on a particular user's
	  machine.

2005-08-14 23:43  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Committing Tom Russo's fix to remove colon chars
	  in track->shapefile save routine.  Seems Cygwin doesn't like
	  colons in filenames.

2005-08-13 09:43  we7u

	* README.win32: Fixing a couple of typos.

2005-08-12 22:21  we7u

	* src/main.c: Moving one define to the top of the file.  This one
	  contains some copyright dates and appears in the Help dialog, so
	  must be updated periodically.  This new location for it is much
	  better than having it hidden in the middle of the file.

2005-08-12 22:07  we7u

	* src/util.c: Adding spaces around the "==" in the #if statement
	  added today.

2005-08-12 20:17  we7u

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Taking out the new MALLOC test added
	  today as AC_FUNC_MALLOC already does what we need.

2005-08-12 14:37  we7u

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac, src/util.c: Adding rpl_malloc()
	  function in util.c, and the associated hooks into acinclude.m4
	  and configure.ac to get it called.  This is to replace malloc()
	  for those cases where malloc() doesn't behave properly.

2005-08-12 14:36  we7u

	* INSTALL: Adding a note about libgc's extra memory usage.

2005-08-12 13:41  we7u

	* config/language-Portuguese.sys: Shortening the Portuguese version
	  of "Enable Weather Alerts" string.

2005-08-12 12:37  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Added a Reset
	  button to the Change Debug Level dialog.

2005-08-12 12:36  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, main.c, map_gdal.c, maps.c, util.c, wx_gui.c:
	  Added a reset button to the Change Debug Level dialog.  Made the
	  Enable WX Alerts menu item be grey'ed out if Shapelib not
	  installed.  Added debug statements multiple places.  Put
	  #ifndef's around a bunch of free(iterator) statements for the
	  case when libgc is configured into the compile (else segfaults
	  occur).

2005-08-12 12:27  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys, language-Spanish.sys:
	  Removing "Counties" from the Enable Weather Alerts text.

2005-08-12 08:38  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c: Adding a custom zoom
	  option to the right-click zoom levels menu.

2005-08-11 13:40  we7u

	* src/main.c: Moving the Center & Zoom dialog to the Maps menu.

2005-08-11 12:46  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Added a default configure/compile at the end,
	  both to test this case and to get the codebase back to normal for
	  the system it's run on.

2005-08-11 12:20  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Removed a couple of el-stupido test cases.
	  Nice'ed everything.

2005-08-10 18:37  we7u

	* configure.ac: Adding warnings so that library dependencies are
	  obvious.  Adding code so that missing dependencies cause
	  dependent libraries to be skipped.

2005-08-10 18:35  we7u

	* INSTALL: Added an ASCII-art drawing showing the library
	  dependencies.

2005-08-10 14:06  we7u

	* configure.ac: Adding another configure warning for missing
	  library.

2005-08-10 12:00  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Adding tests for ALL libraries minus one, each
	  in turn.

2005-08-10 11:58  we7u

	* configure.ac: Forcing use_rtree to OFF and issuing a warning if
	  Shapelib is not being used.

2005-08-10 11:39  we7u

	* src/: main.c, shp_hash.c: Fixing the code for the case where
	  rtree has been requested buy Shapelib is not compiled in.  It
	  makes no sense to do this, but at least it will compile for this
	  case now.

2005-08-10 11:38  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c: Tweaking the Fetch Findu Trail function so that
	  it matches what findu is capable of for the trail duration.
	  Changed the start time and duration time max values to #defines
	  at the top of the file so we can change it more easily next time
	  around.

2005-08-09 08:57  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Fix for broken fix of broken fix of probe for gdal.

	  After I fixed the multiply-included -lgdal issue and made sure
	  that I'd separated out -Ls from -ls, I never made sure that the
	  -l got into LIBS.  I was counting on AC_CHECK_LIB to do that, but
	  it only does so if you don't provide an ACTION-IF-FOUND.

2005-08-08 20:53  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Add ugly hack to work around gdal-config's
	  idiosyncratic merging of LDFLAGS and LIBS data with the single
	  "gdal-config --libs" command.  Other programs with -config
	  scripts have --ldflags and --libs to keep the stuff separate.

2005-08-08 20:18  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Fix broken attempt to replace old flags into
	  variables after failing test.

2005-08-08 14:12  francais1

	* config/language-French.sys: Incorporated most changes from
	  Jacques Chion

2005-08-08 12:27  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c: Adding a debug statement.

2005-08-06 11:11  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Fix up AC_CHECK_GDAL so it uses LIBS instead of
	  LDFLAGS.  This makes it more consistent with other usages.
	  gdal-config --libs actuall returns both LDFLAGS and LIBS type
	  information, and using its output for LDFLAGS winds up putting
	  the -lgdal flag very early in the link line.	This could be a
	  problem on some systems.

2005-08-06 11:05  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Fix dumb mistake in the section that handles the
	  "gdal-config not found" condition.

2005-08-06 11:01  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Make probe for gdal use gdal-config
	  if it can be found.

	  If gdal-config is in the user's path, use it to get LDFLAGS and
	  CPPFLAGS to help the probe for gdal.h and libgdal.a.	Otherwise,
	  use the current settings of LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS and hope they're
	  found.

	  In doing this, I think I see that the probe
	  XASTIR_CHECK_IMAGEMAGICK has a few bugs in it.

2005-08-06 00:14  tvrusso

	* src/db.c: Fix new emergency processing in decode_ax25_line so
	  that it only attempts to work on valid packets.  This was causing
	  segfaults at strcmp(my_callsign,call_sign) when connecting to an
	  internet server (upon receiving the # javAPRServ line), because
	  call_sign was NULL.

2005-08-05 18:14  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Making the output a bit easier to understand.

2005-08-04 20:13  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Using font metrics to determine size of font.
	  We then use that to determine the size for the black rectangle
	  underneath the font.

2005-08-04 12:34  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.h, draw_symbols.c: Drawing a line
	  between the waypoint symbol and the station that originated it.
	  Per the spec.

2005-08-03 18:52  we7u

	* symbols/symbols.dat: Updating a symbol or three.

2005-08-03 13:16  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/interface.c, src/main.c,
	  src/main.h: Have implemented an EMERGENCY BEACON transmit
	  capability.  Look for it under the "Help" menu (appropriate,
	  no?).

2005-08-03 12:15  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: More minor cleanups.  No real changes.

2005-08-03 12:01  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added emergency beacon decode for the string
	  "EMERGENCY" anywhere in the packet, plus the strings:     ALARM
	  ALERT     WARNING	  WXALARM     EM If seen in the TO: field
	  of the packet.  This matches the decoding provided by APRS+SA for
	  this feature.

2005-08-02 13:22  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Small tweaks to improve the output and give us
	  info while it is running instead of all the output at the end.

2005-08-01 21:40  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Changing the order of the individual flag tests
	  to match the summary output order from "configure".

2005-08-01 21:18  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Taking "RELAY" out
	  of the digipeat? label.

2005-08-01 21:16  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Fiximg the grep at the end.

2005-08-01 19:33  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS: Initial checkin.  A "dumb" script the way it is
	  currently written, but it could be made much more intelligent
	  over time, and extended to perform more tests.

2005-08-01 19:29  we7u

	* symbols/symbols.dat: Changing the symbols to be more
	  spec-compliant.  The spec keeps changing on us.  Added an SUV
	  symbol.  Moved the Shelter symbol to the secondary table.
	  Changed the background on the Storm Watch symbol to orange
	  instead of red.  Still need to do the waypoint symbol so it is a
	  red circle and have a line going between it and the mobile
	  transmitting it, plus need to change "No Sym Yet" to a circle
	  with a slash through it, per the latest spec addendum.  It would
	  be worth taking a look at all the symbols to verify compliance.

2005-08-01 19:26  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Getting rid of a compiler warning (unused
	  variable) when ImageMagick isn't compiled in.

2005-08-01 15:08  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c: Move declaration of draw_filled out of WITH_DBFAWK
	  ifdef.

2005-08-01 14:34  we7u

	* src/main.c: Updating the year on the Help->About copyright
	  notice.

2005-08-01 12:43  we7u

	* configure.ac, help/help-English.dat: Bumping version to 1.6.1 for
	  further development.

2005-08-01 11:11  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Updating the what's new section for 1.6.0.

2005-08-01 10:54  we7u

	* README.Contributing, README.Getting-Started, configure.ac,
	  help/help-English.dat: Bumping the version to 1.6.0.

2005-07-30 23:19  we7u

	* src/: bulletin_gui.c, db.c, interface_gui.c, maps.h,
	  locate_gui.c, location_gui.c, main.c, map_gnis.c, messages_gui.c,
	  wx_gui.c: Adding new capability to the Map Feature Search
	  function:  Now returns a chooser dialog that allows seeing up to
	  the first fifty matches for the search, then centering the map on
	  any of them.	Also tweaked array sizes throughout the code used
	  for sending parameters to X11 calls.

2005-07-29 12:32  we7u

	* src/: locate_gui.c, map_gnis.c, maps.h: Changing locate_place()
	  to gnis_locate_place() because it is too similar to the function
	  Locate_place().  Added some comments w.r.t. putting in a chooser
	  option for the Locate Map Feature function.

2005-07-29 12:31  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing some comments.  No code changes.

2005-07-29 12:29  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Calling the new remove_all_spaces() function on
	  one variable read in from the config file.

2005-07-29 12:29  we7u

	* src/: util.c, util.h: Added a "remove_all_spaces" function.

2005-07-28 13:41  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c, src/map_tif.c,
	  src/xa_config.c: Implementing the XOR function for combining USGS
	  DRG colors with underlying map colors.  Changed some labels with
	  respect to this new function.

2005-07-26 12:50  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Changing the DRG
	  Color Filtering labels to the correct color names.

2005-07-26 12:39  tvrusso

	* src/map_gdal.c: Fix extern declaration of draw_shapefile_map

2005-07-26 12:32  tvrusso

	* src/main.c: Add a comment.

2005-07-26 12:16  tvrusso

	  src/map_shp.c, src/map_tif.c, src/maps.c, src/maps.h: Implement
	  auto detection of USGS DRG topo maps (the ones actually from
	  USGS, with proper GeoTIFF tags).

	  Changed map driver interface to take a struct of map flags
	  instead of a single "draw_filled" integer.

	  Changed map properties to support setting of Yes/No/Auto for a
	  given map's "USGS DRG" field.  If Yes, the color map is assumed
	  to be USGS's and the color settings in Map->Configure USGS DRG
	  are used.  If No, all colors in the colormap are displayed.  If
	  Auto, the tiff's Image Description tag is queried and if it
	  begins with "USGS DRG GeoTIFF" then it's as if the setting was
	  Yes, and if it doesn't (or the tag does not exist) then it is as
	  if the setting was No.

	  Added rowcol to map properties dialog to handle the extra buttons
	  without widening the window.

	  Cleaned up the code in main.c that locates the filename in a map
	  properties line.  It was being done by hardcoding the offset in 8
	  places to 31.  Moved the magic number to a preprocessor symbol so
	  it only needs to be changed once now.  There has got to be a
	  cleaner way still, but that's enough for now.

	  Changed all map drivers to support the new map_data_flags struct
	  instead of the int draw_filled.

	  Changed language files.  Not sure I got all of them right.

2005-07-25 10:00  tvrusso

	* src/xa_config.c: Change DRG_COLORS settings so that they default
	  to ON if a config file is read in that doesn't contain the
	  settings.  This will make sure that users who upgrade don't get
	  surprised by having all their topo maps disappear upon upgrading.

2005-07-23 19:29  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,

	  Allows turning on/off various drawing colors on geoTIFF images.

2005-07-22 18:27  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c: Added a couple of defines at the top that control
	  whether we display an entire topo map or just the contours, and
	  which color we display them in.

2005-07-22 12:42  we7u

	* src/util.c: Cleaning up the curl code a bit more:  Removed
	  unnecssary includes and moved the one remaining include up to the

	  the code much easier to maintain and extend.

2005-07-21 21:33  we7u

2005-07-20 11:49  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Adding some comments to the

	  can be successfully used with Xastir.

2005-07-19 22:13  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Added an example of how to use the Fetch
	  trail from Findu timing sliders.

2005-07-19 22:09  we7u

	* src/: main.h, db.c, xa_config.c: Implementing user-configurable
	  digipeater callsigns.  Users will now be able to edit the

	  GUI tie-ins for editing the string at this point.

2005-07-19 21:43  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Adding some more detail about the Map
	  Chooser->Properties dialog.  Adding some new text about the

	  committed to CVS shortly.

2005-07-19 21:41  we7u

	* configure.ac: Reordering the summary.log and Help->About library

2005-07-18 11:12  tvrusso

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Fix for broken DF directional lines when

	  NRQ (or the default of 512 nautical miles.

2005-07-16 23:19  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Allowing the passcode to be longer (up to 20
	  chars).  Useful in a few instances, and similar to what's allowed
	  currently in the AGWPE code.

2005-07-16 23:17  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Adding a #define and some #ifdef's that allow

	  as the fill, the black boundaries are too glaring.

2005-07-12 16:06  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c: Reset stipple style to solid when drawing
	  boundaries of polygons with dbfawk.  They were getting drawin in
	  the stipple pattern used for fill, which made for fuzzy
	  boundaries.

2005-07-11 12:25  we7u

	* configure.ac: Fixing the Geotiff summary line so that it says
	  "no" if libproj isn't found.	It was blank until now in this
	  case.

2005-07-11 12:24  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Moving one line so that this will compile ok
	  without warnings if no ImageMagick.

2005-07-11 10:50  we7u

	* src/xastir.h: If ImageMagick is not found, util.c compile will
	  fail without this change.

2005-07-11 07:55  tvrusso

	* src/main.c: Put use of map_cache_fetch_disable into the same

2005-07-10 08:37  tvrusso

	* scripts/Xastir_tigerpoly.py: Add -d flag to the Usage error
	  message.

2005-07-10 08:36  tvrusso

	* scripts/Xastir_tigerpoly.py: Add "-d" option to this script to
	  allow dissolution of common boundaries between polygons with the
	  same Landmark designation.

	  This is done by scanning all PolyChainLink records, checking that
	  both left and right polygon have associated AreaLandmark records,
	  and that both AreaLandmark records point to the same Land record.
	   If they do, then the two polygons are dissolved into one.

	  The option is not the default.

	  Using this option makes the output shapefile be topologically
	  inequivalent to the original TIGER/Line data, and as such they
	  are suitable only for display.  Distributing data produced in
	  this manner should be done with a prominient disclaimer pointing
	  out that the shapefiles are for display purposes, not serious GIS
	  use.

	  Dissolving polygons in this way makes the TIGER data look much
	  nicer (but still pretty ugly) in xastir -- large landmarks no
	  longer have many copies of the labels, and no longer have ugly
	  internal dashed boundaries that mean nothing.

	* scripts/Xastir_tigerpoly.py: While trying to understand why my
	  TIGER polygon maps have so many identically-named small polygons,
	  I discovered an error in the Xastir_tigerpoly.py script that was
	  propagated from the original GDAL tigerpoly.py script.

	  The TIGER/Line format has a "Type I" record that links complete
	  chains (Type 1) to "GT-Polygons" through the "POLYIDL" and
	  "POLYIDR" attributes.  But according to the TIGER/Line
	  documentation, a Type I record that contains identical POLYIDL
	  and POLYIDR attributes is a line that is internal to a polygon,
	  and should not be included in its boundary.  The original
	  tigerpoly.py script from which Xastir_tigerpoly.py was derived
	  simply added all lines with either POLYIDL or POLYIDR to the
	  boundary of polygon POLYID.  That means that these internal
	  points were not only incorrectly added to the boundary of POLYID,
	  they were added twice.

	  A simple test to throw away such "PolyChainLink" data (in the OGR
	  parlance, "Type I record" in the TIGER parlance) removes this
	  incorrect assembly of polygon boundaries.

	  This does *not* fix the issue of there being lots of tiny,
	  identically-named polygons in a given area (that's just how the
	  data is), but it DOES correct the "Error in computing fill/hole
	  ring" warnings I've been getting since forever, every time these
	  TIGER/Line-converted polygon shapefiles are loaded.  It also
	  fixes the problem I had trying to import these polygon shapefiles
	  into GRASS, which noticed and griped angrily about the
	  topological incorrectness of the data.

	  Unfortunately, taking advantage of this fix would require
	  regenerating all the TIGER polygon shapefiles that are up on
	  xastir.tamu.edu --- probably not worth the effort.  But should
	  there be a new round of corrected TIGER data that gets processed,
	  the script is now producing (more) topologically correct
	  shapefiles.

	  It might be a good idea to feed this back to Frank Warmerdam, on
	  whose tigerpoly.py script Xastir_tigerpoly.py was based.

2005-07-06 12:58  we7u

	* src/: main.h, map_geo.c, map_tiger.c: Adding a parameter to the

2005-06-25 17:30  tvrusso

	* src/maps.c: Undo bonehead commit by KM5VY (me).

	  I had mistakenly thought that "draw_filled" was a new map index
	  parameter, and tried to get the index_retrieve_from_file function
	  to set defaults for shapefiles differently.

	  This was an error, as draw_filled has always existed.

	  There is no way to "fix up" the index when running with new code
	  -- the user is simply going to have to go through the map
	  properties and turn Auto on if he/she wants filled shapefiles to
	  respect the dbfawk file's settings.

	  The reason I thought the commit was right was that I was testing
	  it on an index that had been passed through awk to remove the
	  draw_filled variable.  It then inserted reasonable defaults, but
	  that's not the point.

	  It's unfortunate that a user with an existing batch of filled
	  shapefiles and dbfawk enabled will wind up surprised that they
	  stopped being filled, but that's the way it is.

2005-06-25 09:02  we7u

	* src/util.c: A fix for digipeating:  valid_path() was adding an
	  asterisk on to the end of wideN-n/traceN-n digi's that had n!=N.
	  This caused unused digi's that were earlier in the path to be
	  skipped in the relay_digipeat() code.  For instance a path of
	  "wide1-1,wide2-2" was working, but a path of "wide1-1,wide2-1"
	  was being changed into "wide1-1,wide2-1*", and the wide1-1 digi
	  would be skipped.

2005-06-22 22:47  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c: Fix broken handling of "auto" shapefile filling.

	  There was a test of "draw_filled" to see if it was set to "auto",
	  but if it was, then draw_filled was changed to whatever the
	  dbfawk file "filled" value was.  Since that was always 0 or 1, it
	  meant that every shape after the first one would not have
	  "draw_filled" set to auto anymore, and the entire shapefile would
	  be filled with whatever that first shape's value was (on or off).

2005-06-22 12:47  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Fixing up the default polygon fill condition for

	  src/main.c, src/map_shp.c, src/maps.c, src/maps.h: Implementing
	  an "Auto" function in the Map Properties dialog for polygon
	  fills.  "Auto" will cause a dbfawk file to be used, if it is
	  present.  The "Yes" (On) and "No" (Off) filled options that
	  existed before will now override a dbfawk file, so you can use a
	  Shapefile map in three different ways now from the Map Properties
	  dialog.  I use this "No" option for instance to make the NOAA
	  Counties Shapefile into a vector map so I can overlay it on top
	  of a raster map, use the "Yes" function to use it as a base map
	  of the U.S., or use the "Auto" function to get all the advanced
	  per-object coloring possible from the dbfawk file, including
	  county names, border colors, etc.

	  The default setting for new Shapefiles will be "Auto".  Default
	  for all other types of maps will be "No" or "Off".

	* src/util.c: Adding checks for used-up WIDEn-N/TRACEn-N digipeater
	  slots and for maximum total digipeats to the check_unproto_path()
	  function.  Max digipeats is only allowed to be as high as
	  MAX_WIDES + 1, no more.  For instance, if MAX_WIDES is 4, then
	  "WIDE1-1,WIDE4-4" is legal, "WIDE1-1,WIDE,WIDE4-4", "WIDE5-5", or
	  "WIDE,WIDE,WIDE,WIDE,WIDE,WIDE" are not.

	  nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk: Changing to non-filled.  Will soon try to
	  tweak Xastir code so that the filled option can be chosen in the
	  map properties and override the dbfawk setting, so at least the

	  good base map sometimes.

	  vertical scaling is correct now.

2005-05-23 12:30  we7u

	* src/util.c: Tweaking the lat/long string conversion routines so
	  they'll handle more input formats.

2005-05-20 07:33  we7u

	* src/map_WMS.c: Small tweaks to the URL generation for WMS
	  servers.  Map registration is not correct yet.

2005-05-19 08:43  we7u

	* src/.cvsignore: Adding "xastir" as well so that we won't see that
	  in the CVS status listings.  It's obviously a derived file.

2005-05-19 08:26  we7u

	* .cvsignore, callpass/.cvsignore, config/.cvsignore,
	  help/.cvsignore, m4/.cvsignore, scripts/.cvsignore,
	  src/.cvsignore, src/rtree/.cvsignore, symbols/.cvsignore: Adding
	  more lines to the .cvsignore files in order to clean up CVS
	  status listings.

2005-05-19 08:01  we7u

	* Makefile.am, WMSRadar.geo, src/Makefile.am, src/main.h,
	  src/map_WMS.c, src/map_geo.c: Adding initial support for WMS map
	  formats.  This is not complete yet, but the functionality is
	  enough to give a taste for what is possible in the near future.
	  Registration is still a bit off plus we need to add methods for
	  the user to specify layers desired, specifying WMS servers from
	  the GUI, etc.

2005-05-18 12:24  we7u

	* src/gps.c: Modified parsing of GPGGA and GPRMC NMEA sentences to
	  handle more variations in the sentence structure.

2005-05-18 12:23  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing some comments and debug statements having to
	  do with GPGGA and GPRMC NMEA sentence parsing.

2005-05-18 09:41  we7u

	* src/gps.c: Tweak to the GPGGA parsing to allow a '3' for GPS fix
	  quality.

2005-05-17 13:41  we7u

	* src/util.c: I've had this patch around for a couple of weeks.  It
	  should allow matching on non-numeric SSID's for messaging now,
	  such as "WHO-IS" and "AE5PL-EM", which are the two test cases
	  that broke messaging earlier.  It has not been fully tested on RF
	  yet, but appears to work when directly on the internet feeds.

2005-05-09 10:09  we7u

	* configure.ac, help/help-English.dat: Setting up for further CVS
	  development of Xastir.  Changing rev to 1.5.1 to differentiate it
	  from the 1.5.0 stable release.  Added a new "What's New in Xastir
	  BETA" section to the help-English.dat file.

2005-05-09 09:34  we7u

	* README.Contributing, README.Getting-Started, configure.ac,
	  help/help-English.dat: Updating for soon to be done 1.5.0
	  release.

2005-05-09 09:32  we7u

2005-05-06 13:59  we7u

	* src/awk.c: Another tweak by by John Laxson, KC0PZN.  This one
	  fixes something that I messed up when I incorporated his first
	  patch.

2005-05-05 12:36  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changed one comment.  No code changes.

2005-05-05 12:23  we7u

2005-05-05 12:19  we7u

	* README: Getting rid of version number where it's not needed.
	  Will save us some work in the future.

2005-04-29 15:06  kd6zwr

	* src/interface.c: Fixes for segmentation faults on Solaris.
	  Sending a NULL pointer to a %s argument to any of the *printf()
	  functions (actually strlen() inside it) causes the fault.  This
	  patch intializes two vars to "" instead of NULL, {Which is OK!!}
	  protects a function by whacking NULLs into ""s, and moves a debug
	  printf below a NULL check.

2005-04-26 11:24  we7u

	* src/interface.c: If an interface goes down due to a connection
	  being lost or inactivity, the 1st check_ports() call will bring
	  it back up now.  Previously it would wait for the 2nd
	  check_ports() call before bringing it back up.

2005-04-25 12:44  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Added a paragraph about splitting large Shapefiles
	  into tiles.

2005-04-25 12:44  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started: Minor changes to a couple of sentences.

2005-04-19 10:39  we7u

2005-04-17 21:31  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Updated the "what's new", shamelessly
	  ripping parts of curt's release notes because I'm behind in
	  keeping up with CVS. :-P

2005-04-15 10:42  we7u

	* xastir.spec.in: Adding a few more docs to the doc list.

2005-04-15 10:02  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, interface.h, interface_gui.c, xa_config.c:
	  Changes by Andreas Bier, DL1HRC, to allow setting a tnc2multi
	  into KISS mode via a togglebutton on the interface dialog.  We
	  can probably extend this later to put other types of TNC's into
	  KISS mode and/or to take them out of KISS mode when shutting down
	  the interface.

	  I also changed the default for new interfaces to have
	  RELAY/WIDE1-1 digipeat turned off.

2005-04-13 08:50  we7u

	* src/util.c: Fixing a path check problem.  It wasn't verifying
	  that the char before the '-' was a digit before applying N-n
	  checks to the callsign.

2005-04-12 21:12  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started: Pointing to a list of 2nd-tier servers
	  instead of suggesting Firenet.us.

2005-04-12 08:50  we7u

	  tnc-startup.kam, tnc-startup.kpc2, tnc-startup.kpc3,

2005-04-11 12:51  we7u

	* FAQ, README.Getting-Started: Updating the path discussions to
	  cover the new scheme (WIDE1-1 instead of RELAY).

2005-04-06 12:26  we7u

	* src/: db.c, util.c: Making the "RELAY" digipeat work with either
	  RELAY or WIDE1-1, per the latest APRSSIG recommendations on how
	  to do paths and digipeating.

2005-04-06 10:03  we7u

	* src/util.c: Allowing WIDE1-1 as a RELAY type of callsign per the
	  new paradism.

2005-03-31 12:43  we7u

	* src/: db.c, util.c: Fixes to make the new WHO-IS server work with
	  Xastir.

2005-03-30 09:12  we7u

	* src/: map_geo.c, map_tiger.c, util.c: Changing text of one type
	  of error message.

2005-03-25 22:33  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Added a note about a blemish in the Haversine
	  formula we use for distance calculation.

2005-03-25 12:53  we7u

	* scripts/permutations.pl: Changes to the comments/description.

2005-03-25 12:26  we7u

	* src/datum.h: Changing some comments.

2005-03-25 09:06  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Added a summary regarding our distance/angle/area
	  calculations.

2005-03-24 12:25  we7u

	* src/: datum.h, main.c, util.c: Switching to Gerry-recommended
	  Earth radii plus putting them into central defines in datum.h.
	  That makes them easier to update in the future.

2005-03-23 22:05  we7u

	* src/main.c: Converting the Measure function from calculating area
	  via planar geometry to computing it using spherical calculations.
	  It should be much closer to reality now, particularly as one
	  zooms out.

2005-03-23 21:57  we7u

	* src/util.c: Changing some comments.

2005-03-23 21:51  we7u

	* src/util.h: Making a couple of routines available to other
	  modules.

2005-03-23 12:36  we7u

	* src/util.c: Converting the distance calculations from using the
	  Law of Cosines for Spherical Geometry to using the Haversine
	  Formula.  This should be more accurate for shorter distances, no
	  real change for longer distances.

2005-03-23 09:33  we7u

	* src/main.c: Bumping the check interval for inactivity from 1
	  minute to 5 minutes.	This means that if we lose an internet
	  connection we might not get it back for between 10 to 15 minutes
	  (instead of the current 2 to 3 minutes), but it also means that
	  server connections won't bounce up and down as much if there are
	  few packets coming down the pipe.  One packet every 5 minutes is
	  enough to keep the connection going.

2005-03-22 15:10  we7u

	* src/util.c: Changed some comments.

2005-03-22 13:11  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Added/changed some comments.

2005-03-22 12:38  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started: Added an enumeration of the various ways
	  of controlling Xastir itself.

2005-03-21 20:57  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, draw_symbols.c: Fixes for DF objects to
	  make the beamwidths and angles correct.  Also fixed the
	  "Unusable" beamwidth so that it still appears as a DF object in
	  the Object->Modify dialog.

2005-03-20 16:33  tvrusso

	* src/testawk.c: Add initializer for pattern, add variable for
	  label_color, and add appropriate code so that dbfawk files that
	  set label_color can be tested.

	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/util.c, src/db.c: Fixing
	  decoding of compressed DF beam objects/items.  Fixing the display
	  in Station Info of DF stations.

2005-03-18 12:09  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Fixes for varying truncation on object/item
	  comments.  We were allowing comments that were longer than 43
	  chars, which were truncated during later transmits by
	  check_and_transmit_objects_items().  We now no longer allow the
	  extra length packets to be transmitted.  The spaces that were
	  added for Pmin/Pmax are now no longer added: that was another
	  cause for the varying truncation of the comment.

	  Fixed the object/item transmit routines so that we can now send
	  compressed-mode for all types.  The decode routines now have to
	  catch up.

2005-03-17 13:16  we7u

	* src/db.c: Better implmentation of my debug tweak that will work
	  with more compilers.

2005-03-17 13:07  we7u

	* src/db.c: Removing some comments.

2005-03-17 12:30  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: More work on dead-reckoning to position the
	  ghost symbols and the dashed lines correctly.  Have disabled the
	  arcs for now as the positioning is not correct for them with the
	  current code.

2005-03-17 12:28  we7u

	* src/util.c: Added poor-man's rounding to the places we construct
	  the transmitted lat/long's.  This helps with dead-reckoning of
	  symbols at close-in zoom levels.

2005-03-17 12:27  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added a define and some ifndef's to make some debug
	  easier.

2005-03-17 07:34  we7u

	  main.c, map_geo.c, map_gnis.c, map_shp.c, map_tif.c, maps.c,
	  util.c, wx.c, xa_config.c: Checking the return codes for

2005-03-16 12:15  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, db.c: Checking the return codes of
	  scanf/sscanf/fscanf functions.

2005-03-16 11:34  we7u

	* src/util.c: A workaround for an sscanf() bug that shows up on
	  Cygwin.  It wasn't parsing the lat/long properly in
	  compress_posit().  Re-coded the routine to do everything
	  manually.  The other 60 or so places that scanf() and it's
	  variants are used should also be checked for correct operation on
	  Cygwin.

2005-03-15 16:50  we7u

	* src/util.c: Fix for incorrect compressed packets on Cygwin.
	  Evidently the 'N' in the latitude is getting passed to the
	  routine as an 'n', which causes the problem.	The root cause of
	  the problem is probably that the latitude variable is getting
	  messed up sometime earlier.

2005-03-15 11:25  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Tweaks for Davis WX station by Clay Jackson, n7qnm.

2005-03-14 17:58  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c: Decoding weather from "Position with
	  Timestamp no APRS messaging" packets.

2005-03-14 13:15  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, main.c: Fixing a bug that crept in while
	  coding some object/item stuff.  Moving some comments to a more
	  appropriate place.  Commenting out the last_modified_time
	  variable for now, as it's not actually implemented in the
	  dead-reckoning code yet.

2005-03-13 19:11  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, main.c: Dead-reckoning of objects and
	  items:  Working a bit better with this version.  We now use the
	  latest DR'ed position when making a change to the object/item.
	  Moving a DR'ed object/item works.  One thing that doesn't work
	  now is trying to update the position of a moving object/item
	  using the Modify dialog:  The lat/long boxes are ignored now in
	  favor of the DR'ed position.	Also note that the on-screen DR
	  function is a bit off in speed and direction from the more
	  accurate function that actually moves the object along.  This is
	  yet to be fixed.

2005-03-11 22:38  we7u

	* src/db.c: Dead-reckoning for compressed objects/items as well.

2005-03-11 22:10  we7u

	* src/db.c: Better accuracy for the angle calculations for object
	  dead-reckoning.

2005-03-11 21:19  we7u

	* src/db.c: Transmitting dead-reckoned object/item positions is
	  starting to work in this version.  More to do yet, but it could
	  be useful as-is.

2005-03-11 08:45  we7u

	* src/db.c: Commenting out the code that moves dead-reckoned
	  objects.  Not correct yet.

2005-03-11 07:52  we7u

	* src/db.c: Initial version of dead-reckoning for objects.
	  Dead-reckoned positions are transmitted now at the decaying
	  transmit interval.  Still need to do more work on this, like
	  computing the latest dead-reckoned position and transmitting that
	  position at the point an object/item is changed, correcting the
	  disparity between the on-screen DR and the transmitted DR
	  (on-screen DR appears to compute angle based on screen pixels,
	  while the transmitted DR computes angle based on lat/long).  The
	  log file is ignored in these changes also:  If Xastir crashes or
	  is shut down, time for the DR object will be lost and it will
	  start DR'ing at the point it was last transmitted at before
	  shutdown.

2005-03-10 13:02  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, main.c: Preliminary work for fixing
	  dead-reckoning of objects/items.  More to do yet, but this
	  last_modified_time variable is needed to get started on the
	  problem.

2005-03-08 13:05  we7u

	* src/main.c: Mods by Dan Brown, N8YSZ.  Prevent multiple Xastir's

	* README: Added a note about gating stations, objects, and items to
	  RF.

2005-03-02 11:41  we7u

	* src/igate.c: Removing a debug printf that is used for checking
	  out gating to RF.

2005-03-02 09:39  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Fix for an annoying warning that X11 puts
	  out when you add an interface in Xastir.

2005-03-02 08:56  tvrusso

	* src/map_tif.c: Comment out warning when a geotiff file has no
	  PCS.

	  Geotiffs without PCS (Projected Coordinate System) tags are
	  assumed to be lat/lon rasters.  Now that this capability is being
	  more widely used, especially by users outside the US, this
	  warning is just an annoyance.  It was only there because it was
	  once cause to reject a raster if it had no PCS.

2005-03-01 12:55  we7u

	* src/igate.c: Allowing nws-stations.txt changes to take effect
	  right away for stations being gated to RF.  If the file has been
	  changed, the in-memory database gets updated.

2005-03-01 12:32  we7u

	* src/main.c: Allow re-creating of an object or item that has been
	  killed and is still in the database.	Previous code wouldn't
	  allow that and brought up a warning popup.  Now the popup happens
	  only if a "live" object/item is in the database with the same
	  name.

2005-03-01 12:05  we7u

	* src/: igate.h, db.c, igate.c: Igating of specific objects/items
	  to RF is now possible by listing the object or item name in
	  data/nws-stations.txt.  The listing is case-insensitive.  Putting
	  a wild-card source callsign in that file doesn't get
	  objects/items from that station igated to RF, but other packets
	  from that callsign do get gated.  Objects/items have to be
	  specifically listed by name, as the code stands now.

2005-03-01 11:36  we7u

	* src/db.c: Proper RF gating of objects/items when the originating
	  callsign is specified in the data/nws-stations.txt file.  The
	  previous code was incorrect w.r.t. object/item gating.

2005-03-01 09:09  we7u

	* src/: db.c, igate.c: Initial attempt at gating individual
	  stations through to RF, if those stations are spelled out in the
	  data/nws-stations.txt file.  Wildcarding is inherent, so "we7u"
	  will match "we7u", "we7ua", and "we7uaa" through "we7uzz".  This
	  change also means that any packets (like posits perhaps) from an
	  NWS station that are not weather alerts will now get gated to RF.
	  Hopefully this won't be a problem.  I've left an fprintf() in
	  the code so you'll see which new packets are gated through to RF
	  (prints to STDERR).  We'll remove that fprintf() later once we're
	  satisfied with the new operation.

2005-02-28 09:11  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.c, draw_symbols.h: Fixing the selected
	  stations count (on status bar) for dead-reckoned stations.  They
	  were getting counted twice, once for the non-ghosted and once for
	  the ghosted symbol.

	* README: Bring some of the FreeBSD notes up to date.  It is no
	  longer necessary to use "gmake" instead of "make" with xastir's
	  build on FreeBSD, and the comments about autoconf versions were

	  Also, change reference to the "current" version 1.1.x of xastir.

2005-02-18 11:38  we7u

	* README: Changes suggested by Dan Brown, plus another one or two
	  added by me.	Fixing mailing list and Xastir link addresses.

2005-02-17 01:14  we7u

	* src/util.c: Better version of the function which checks the
	  unproto paths as they are entered by the user.  This one checks
	  for all the proper relations between the n-N numbers, and limits
	  them to MAX_WIDES (which is set in util.h).

2005-02-16 15:20  tvrusso

	* src/util.c: Repair check_unproto_path to fix mistakes I'd made in
	  last commit (atoi() on a character rather than string), and
	  rearrange things so that some odd usages in the original code
	  still work.

	  I have not cleaned it up properly.  Instances of changing
	  character pointers in a conditional remain as they were in
	  original code, and flagging "bad" paths like "WIDE1-2" results in
	  "Path too long" error message when it should say instead "very
	  strange path".  But it will NOT reject paths like WIDE2-1
	  anymore, and will accept paths like WIDE7-2 (even though the
	  first digit is essentially meaningless when used this way).

	  This time I actually tested these fixes and they work.

	* src/util.c: Simple change to stop "WIDEN-n" where N!=n being
	  flagged as a "Bad Path"

	  Instead, it now checks that N>=n, and only reports "N<n" as a bad
	  path.

	  The "N!=n is bad" has been there since October 2004, when the
	  path-checking code was first added.

	  This addresses comment raised on xastir mailing list on 16 Feb
	  2005.

	* AUTHORS, FAQ, INSTALL, README, README.Getting-Started,
	  README.MAPS, README.win32, changes.txt, xastir.1, xastir.spec.in,
	  help/help-English.dat: Fixing up the APRS trademark text.

2005-01-29 09:32  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, messages_gui.c: Fix for the "(null)" text
	  appearing in the Packet Data dialog when using custom messages.
	  It now reports the path being used.

2005-01-28 17:16  we7u

	* src/maps.c: More speedups, this time in index_retrieve().  This
	  takes it way down the profiling list so that it isn't an issue
	  anymore.

2005-01-26 13:36  we7u

	* src/util.c: Fix for bug pointed out by Tapio Sokura.	We could
	  end up with an item name with a ';' character in it, an the
	  previous if/then contructs would guess wrong.

2005-01-26 13:30  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fix for objects/items deleted by someone else.  Xastir
	  wasn't calling the disown_object_item() function previously for
	  this case.

2005-01-26 13:27  we7u

	* src/util.c: Added debug statement.  Currently commented out.

2005-01-26 13:11  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Making sure that any paths are in upper-case as
	  transmitted.

2005-01-25 18:11  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Tweaks so that any transmit will show in the
	  Display Packet Data dialog, one per interface which has transmit
	  enabled and is active.  This allows the user to see the paths
	  being used for each transmit for each interface.  The transmit
	  string used to show a generic path before, plus would appear in
	  that dialog whether any interfaces were up/transmit enabled.
	  Also, if transmit objects was disabled, the dialog used to show a
	  transmit as if something went out.  This has been fixed.  Minor
	  problems remain such as a "(null)" as a path for x-spider
	  interface transmits.	Perhaps other interfaces might have the
	  similar problems.

2005-01-25 15:43  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added some debug code for testing Serial KISS
	  interfaces.

2005-01-24 22:05  we7u

	* DEBUG_LEVELS, FAQ, INSTALL, README, README.CVS,
	  README.Getting-Started, README.MAPS, README.win32, UPGRADE,
	  help/help-English.dat: Spelling corrections.

2005-01-24 13:52  we7u

	* README.win32: Tweaks to the gdal install instructions: *)
	  Requires Shapelib so that Xastir can configure in GDAL *) More
	  configure options needed for GDAL so that it will
	  configure/compile    on Win32 systems.

2005-01-23 12:49  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h, map_shp.c, util.c, wx_gui.c, maps.c,
	  db.c: Hash table implementation for weather alert storage.  This
	  makes things much faster.  Still have alert_list[] array used in
	  one place in alert.c.  That bit of code needs to be rewritten.

2005-01-21 12:40  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Another minor speedup for the weather alert code.
	  Getting rid of a couple of unnecessary calls.  Renaming one
	  function so that it's uses are clear.

2005-01-20 15:57  we7u

	* src/db.c: Faster-yet is_my_call() function.

2005-01-20 15:40  we7u

	* src/db.c: Minor efficiency increase for is_my_call() function.
	  We don't need to check the length of the two strings as strcmp()
	  does that already.

2005-01-20 09:51  tvrusso

	* configure.ac: Move AH_BOTTOM call up to near the AC_CHECK_TYPES
	  that tests for socklen_t

2005-01-20 09:38  tvrusso

	* acconfig.h, configure.ac: Remove deprecated acconfig.h file.

	  Add "modern" usage of AH_BOTTOM to configure.ac to accomplish the
	  same thing.

2005-01-19 23:27  tvrusso

	* src/map_gnis.c: Add check that latitude and longitude fields
	  actually begin with digits before attempting to use the fields as
	  lat/lon values.

	  This fixes the bogus bounding box problem that was leading to
	  xastir loading gnis files that should have been out of view.	It
	  had been showing all GNIS files as having the equator as lower
	  boundary, for example.

2005-01-19 16:45  shadow

	* acconfig.h, src/interface.c: deal with socklen_t not being
	  defined everywhere

2005-01-18 09:06  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.c: Fixing the selected station count (on
	  the status line) so that it more accuractely reflects the number
	  of stations on the screen (whatever made it through the station
	  filters).

2005-01-15 21:15  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Updates to the helpfile.

2005-01-14 09:07  tvrusso

	* INSTALL: Add a brief note about enabling spatial indexing, and a
	  reference to the original author's web site per request.

2005-01-13 20:16  tvrusso

	* src/rtree/: card.c, card.h, gammavol.c, index.c, index.h, node.c,
	  rect.c, sources.htm, sphvol.c, split_l.c, split_l.h, split_q.c,
	  split_q.h: Correct name and contact information for author of the
	  rtree code per her request.

2005-01-12 20:02  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c: Add a couple of lines of debugging output
	  (selectable with debug level 16) to try to track down why labels
	  for weather alerts aren't showing up until the map is refreshed,
	  and not the first time it's drawn.

2005-01-11 17:30  we7u

	* src/: main.c, db.c, util.c, util.h: New code which uses a hash
	  table to store the tactical callsigns.  This gets the tactical
	  callsign number out of the total stations received number, plus
	  should be a better implementation all the way around after all
	  the minor bugs are found.

2005-01-10 18:06  we7u

	* src/: main.c, util.c: Fixing the slight Maidenhead grid problem
	  (off by one).  Starting to implement a new set of tactical call
	  functions, but the old system is currently still in place.  When
	  fully implemented the tactical call quantity won't add to our
	  received station count number.

2005-01-10 13:39  we7u

	* src/util.c: Added some comments.

2005-01-10 13:39  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Changes to comments/white-space only.

2005-01-09 16:09  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c: Add additional cases for switch statement to allow
	  3D point and polygon files to be recognized and displayed.  All
	  these do is let the 3D versions be treated by the same code as
	  the 2D versions --- the Z coordinate is simply ignored.

	  If xastir ever becomes a 3D-rendering APRS code these cases could
	  be handled differently.

	  I have no instances of 3D point or polygon shapefiles, so did not
	  test these changes.  The 3D polyline cases I have do display
	  properly.

2005-01-09 15:10  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c: Add two tiny changes that allow 3-D polyline
	  shapefiles to be displayed.

	  All this does is allow xastir to recognize 3D polyline shapefiles
	  (SHPT_ARCZ) and display them as if they were 2-D (by ignoring all
	  but the X and Y coordinates).  The finnish shapefiles that were
	  causing the crash fixed by the previous commit were 3D shapefiles
	  that can now be displayed without first being converted to 2D
	  with ogr2ogr.

2005-01-09 15:06  tvrusso

	* src/: map_shp.c, shp_hash.c: map_shp.c:  move block of code that
	  accesses rtrees and shapefile hashes to after the block that
	  includes the "return if just indexing".  This lets us skip the
	  hashtable lookup and rtree generation for maps that are merely
	  being index.

	  shp_hash.c: add a test before RTreeInsertRect to make sure that
	  the bounding box being passed is valid (i.e. that it won't fail
	  the assertion inside the RTreeInsertRect routine), and skip the
	  shape if not.

	  This should fix the crashes Curt was seeing a few days ago when
	  including some defective Finland shapefiles in his map directory.

2005-01-09 11:46  tvrusso

	* src/: Makefile.am, rtree/Makefile.am: Fix for distribution
	  problems:

	    add DIST_SUBDIRS line so that distribution generation doesn't
	  have a
	    conditional.  This allows conditional compilation, but
	  unconditional
	    distribution of the directory.

	    fix SOURCES line in src/rtree/Makefile.am to reference only
	  files that exist

2005-01-09 11:30  tvrusso

	* src/Makefile.am: Undo change made this morning.  Forcing rtree
	  into the SUBDIRS means that it will be built even if the user
	  hasn't specified --with-rtree.  If it fails to build Makefile.in
	  in the rtree directory then a different solution (perhaps
	  changing configure.ac so it doesn't try to generate
	  src/rtree/Makefile) is needed.

	  But I can't reproduce the problem --- every time I run bootstrap
	  it generates the Makefile.in in the rtree directory.

2005-01-09 10:54  we7u

2005-01-04 09:20  we7u

	  was done in error, and caused the previous commit to be undone.

2005-01-04 09:06  we7u

	* src/: interface.h, interface.c, interface_gui.c: Fixing the
	  Interface Control dialog so that it updates immediately whenever
	  status of an interface changes.

2005-01-03 17:28  we7u

	* src/: messages.c, messages_gui.c: Interface control dialog now
	  changes quickly when status on an interface changes.

2005-01-03 11:30  we7u

	* src/maps.c: The XpmWriteFileFromPixmap() library call was changed
	  so as to not allow absolute paths.  We had to change our code to
	  comply with the new XPM API.

2005-01-03 10:28  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Tweaks suggested by Tom Russo to more fully report
	  errors from XpmWriteFileFromPixmap().  I added returns for the
	  cases where we get these errors so that we don't try to continue
	  processing non-existent or ancient snapshot or print files.

2005-01-01 21:26  tvrusso

	* scripts/split_gnis.pl, src/map_gnis.c: split_gnis.pl:  remove
	  dependency on Text::CSV_XS, change to work with current gnis
	  files.  The script was apparently written when gnis files were
	  still comma separated, but that's not true anymore.

	  map_gnis: changes to a few comments.

2004-12-30 23:56  we7u

	* src/: messages.c, messages_gui.c: Fixes so that the current path
	  setting in the Send Message dialog takes effect for messages in
	  the outgoing queue and ack's in the delayed ack queue.

2004-12-30 13:21  we7u

	* src/: util.c, util.h: Adding the xastir_debug() function which we
	  can use instead of our current scheme for dumping out extra
	  messages to STDERR during various stages of debugging.

2004-12-30 08:36  we7u

	* src/messages.c: Tweak to cause Send Message and Send Group
	  Message dialogs to pop to the top of the window stack when new
	  messages are received.

2004-12-30 08:34  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fix for directed version query so that it doesn't pop

2004-12-29 12:59  we7u

	* src/db.c: Storing the 3rd-party path in the station record for
	  the case were we hear the 3rd-party packet on RF and haven't
	  heard the station directly on RF for at least the last hour.

2004-12-29 12:31  we7u

	* src/: db.c, interface.c: Adding the transmitted packets into the
	  Incoming Data dialog.  Doesn't include posits that we're sending.
	  Only one copy of the outgoing data is shown, no matter how many
	  ports we have open, and the path that is shown is the one we'd
	  use for a network interface, as we change the transmitted path
	  based on the interface type normally.

	  set in the Send Message dialog, change the path on delayed ACK's
	  to match the current custom path, and tweaks to change the path
	  on pending TX messages to match the current custom path.  Also
	  have a change in here to bring up a popup if a custom message is
	  entered and the Send Message dialog is closed (thereby throwing
	  away the custom path), but couldn't get it to trigger only when
	  desired, so that function is commented out at present.

2004-12-28 13:04  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changing one debug fprintf statement.

2004-12-28 12:29  we7u

	* src/: db.c, messages.h, messages_gui.c, view_message_gui.c,
	  xa_config.c: Making sure VIEW_MESSAGE_LIMIT can't be set too low.
	  Adding some tweaks so that the custom path set in the Send
	  Message dialog will get used for ACK's as well, assuming the
	  dialog doesn't get closed.

	* README.win32: Updating the notes about the CD's a bit.

2004-12-27 22:16  tvrusso

	* config/nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk, config/nwsfz_ddmmyy.dbfawk,
	  config/nwsmzddmmyy.dbfawk, config/nwsozddmmyy.dbfawk,
	  config/nwsw_ddmmyy.dbfawk, config/nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk,
	  src/map_shp.c: Change all dbfawk files for NWS county/zone
	  shapefiles so the display_level is very high.

	  Until last week or so, display_level was always ignored for
	  polygon shapefiles, so this didn't matter.  Now that
	  draw_shapefile_map actually uses the parameter for these it
	  becomes important that the value be big enough to display such
	  shapefiles at reasonable zooms.

	  map_shp.c: change display_level in default dbfawk rule (the one
	  used when no dbfawk file is found) to have display_level=65536.
	  This means that a shapefile for which no dbfawk file is found
	  will always have all of its lines and polygons displayed at
	  almost all zoom levels, unless the user disables display of that
	  shapefile using map properties min/max zoom parameters.

2004-12-26 13:13  we7u

	* src/: db.c, messages.c: More tweaks to the delayed ack queue for
	  messaging.  We now check for ack's that are too close together
	  time-wise in the queue and refuse to queue them up.  We don't
	  want to send too many ack's all together and trash the channel.

2004-12-26 10:57  tvrusso

	* src/: map_shp.c, maps.c: Add facility to purge dbfawk signatures
	  on map index operation.  They are reloaded upon first shapefile
	  redraw.

2004-12-26 10:54  tvrusso

	* src/rtree/.cvsignore: Add a .cvsignore file to the rtree
	  directory, ignore Makefile.in

2004-12-26 01:10  we7u

	* src/: db.c, messages.c, messages.h, main.c: Adding the capability
	  to schedule ACK's some number of seconds out.  We now use this to
	  schedule ack's at t+30, t+60, and t+90 seconds if we find that
	  we're getting duplicate messages from a station we're conversing
	  with.

2004-12-25 18:15  we7u

	* src/: db.c, bulletin_gui.c: Fixing bulletins so that they don't
	  pop up unless we wish them to.  Must have broken that recently
	  with some other changes.

2004-12-24 15:28  we7u

	* src/db.c: Making the Send Message window update when we get an
	  ACK.

2004-12-24 12:27  we7u

	* src/db.c: There _are_ code changes in this commit.  This tweak
	  gets rid of the constantly popping-up Send Message dialogs when
	  you're doing messaging.  If you start a QSO and then close the
	  dialog, it should pop up again on the FIRST ACK that you receive,
	  on a TIMEOUT of the message, or on the FIRST INSTANCE OF A NEW
	  MESSAGE from the other party.

2004-12-24 12:16  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Added a debug message, then commented it out.
	  No code changes.

	* src/messages.c: Comment changes.  No code changes.

2004-12-24 12:12  we7u

	* src/messages.h: Added a comment.  No code changes.

2004-12-24 10:55  tvrusso

	* src/: messages_gui.c, shp_hash.c: message_gui.c:  add test to
	  get_path_data to make sure it never tries to use a null pointer
	  in xastir_snprintf.  It is now possible for xastir to leave a
	  path null when it receives a posit or message via RF that has
	  been gated to RF from an Igate.  Until that's fixed, it's
	  important not to try to dereference the null pointer.

	  shp_hash.c add standard xastir header comments.

2004-12-24 00:50  tvrusso

	* src/: hashtable_itr.c, shp_hash.c: Re-insert line I accidentally
	  deleted along with debugging cruft, comment out line that
	  declared variable only used in debugging to silence warnings.

2004-12-23 23:39  tvrusso

	* src/: hashtable_itr.c, hashtable_itr.h, shp_hash.c: For-sure fix
	  of segfaults in the new "decaying rtree" stuff.

	  Turns out that the hashtable_iterator code has some built-in
	  assumptions that we'll never actually have an empty hashtable.
	  The hashtable_iterator_value routine always dereferenced the
	  entry it pointed to, even though hashtable_iterator sets that to
	  null if the table's empty.

	  Rather than insert code all over the place that tests the
	  internals of the iterator structure, I've hacked on the
	  hashtable_iterator code to return null if it was asked for
	  nonsense, and tests for null pointers before dereferencing.

	  Also, the hashtable_itr.h file defined inline versions of the
	  hashtable_iterator_key and hashtable_iterator_value functions
	  even though hashtable_iterator.c defined them as regular
	  functions.  This was a source of much additional baldness when
	  trying to debug until I realized it.	Ifdef'd those out.

2004-12-23 23:19  we7u

	* src/db.c: Getting rid of the multiple audio alerts or speech
	  alerts upon receipt of a message.  Should only alert on the first
	  copy of each now.

2004-12-23 21:51  we7u

	* src/: messages.h, messages_gui.c: In the Send Message dialog:
	  Moving the reverse path test into its own uneditable text field.
	  It is too problematic trying to use it by default for messaging,
	  but it's a useful reference for choosing the outgoing custom path
	  for the QSO.

	* src/map_cache.c: Tweaks by Dan Brown, N8YSZ.

2004-12-23 07:57  tvrusso

	* src/: map_shp.c, shp_hash.c: Add check for hashtable iterator
	  being null before using it.  If we've been idle for a long time
	  then it could be the case that the entire hashtable's been purged
	  and so this test is necessary.  I think this was the source of
	  the segfaults I saw over the past couple of days after several
	  hours of unattended operation.

2004-12-22 23:54  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c: Changing the format of messages in the
	  View->Message Traffic window to single-line format, unless the
	  line is long in which case it wraps.

2004-12-22 19:09  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c: Fix for a logic mistake I introduced last night.

	  This might be the source of the unpredictable segfaults I'm
	  seeing at random times hours apart.  If not, I'll get that one
	  pinned down ASAP.  This was still a mistake, even if it's not the
	  source of those.

2004-12-22 14:56  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, main.c, main.h: Fixing selected station
	  count so that it updates immediately on the status line if the
	  number changes.  Change the "stations" variable to
	  "station_count" to make it easier to grep for in the future.

2004-12-22 14:49  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Fixing Interface Control dialog so that it
	  looks the same after properties have been changed.  It had been
	  missing the up/down designation per port.

2004-12-22 10:07  we7u

	* src/: main.c, main.h, db.c: Making the selected stations count on
	  the status line update quickly when it changes.

2004-12-22 08:44  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing the Select All button in Map
	  Chooser->Properties so that it doesn't toggle the selections, but
	  actually does what its label says it'll do.

2004-12-21 23:18  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changes to Group Messages/Queries so that multi-line
	  messages will show in the dialog, and so that messages that don't
	  require ack's don't show up as unacked (highlighted) in the
	  dialog.

2004-12-21 22:48  tvrusso

	* src/rtree/node.c: Clean up debugging output mistakenly committed.

2004-12-21 22:22  tvrusso

	* src/: main.c, map_shp.c, maps.c, maps.h, shp_hash.c, shp_hash.h,
	  rtree/node.c: Round of RTree usage optimizations.

	  1) If a shapefile's bounding box is entirely contained in the
	  current viewport,    don't bother doing an RTreeSearch for
	  visible shapes --- just read the    file sequentially.  Don't
	  even bother accessing the hash table for the file.

	  2) Store a time stamp every time a shapefiles hash table entry is
	  accessed.

	  3) Every hour, walk through the hash table and purge records that
	  have not    been accessed in 1 hour.	(this needs to become a
	  configurable time)

	  This should improve memory usage for a few special use cases, and
	  free up RAM wasted on shapefiles that are not really going to
	  benefit from having the RTree fast lookup.

	  I've not run this for long times to see how the memory usage
	  behaves --- once the RTree is allocated and freed, the processes
	  resident size doesn't seem to drop down, but it does make the
	  space that was freed available for indexing a different
	  shapefile.

	  There are probably many ways to make this even more flexible and
	  automatically adaptive to the users' usage patterns.	This should
	  be a good start, though.

	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/main.h, src/main.c:
	  The ST_DIRECT stuff appears to be fixed now.	This tweak makes
	  the APRS-Direct query work properly again plus adds a
	  selected/total stations display to the status line where there
	  was just total stations listed before.

2004-12-21 19:23  we7u

	* src/db.c: Another tweak to the ST_DIRECT stuff.  This tweak
	  causes us to overwrite the saved path only if 1) the current
	  packet is direct, 2) the ST_DIRECT path is not set, or 3)
	  ST_DIRECT is set but nothing has been heard direct for the last
	  hour.  The end result is that we should see the most recent
	  directly-heard path in Station Info, unless the station has not
	  been heard direct for the last hour, in which case we may see a
	  digipeated path or an INET path there.

2004-12-21 17:35  we7u

	* src/db.c: More work on fixing up the ST_DIRECT flag.

2004-12-21 12:29  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c: Attempting a fix to the ST_DIRECT bit
	  being set incorrectly at times, for stations that straddle both
	  RF and INET feeds.  Lots of things were inter-related here, so
	  this may not be the final fix.  It should be better than the old
	  code though.

	* src/: map_shp.c, shp_hash.c, rtree/index.c, rtree/index.h,

	  In each case here where gcc whined about possible use of
	  variables before initialization, code was in place that would
	  always set that variable first.  But it was all in conditionals
	  that gcc couldn't possibly know were always true before any use
	  of the variables.  Added initializers to shut it up.

	  then alert the operator that we've done so via a popup message.

2004-12-19 18:56  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added code to check for incorrect case in queries and
	  notify us.  This may be used to send a message back to the

2004-12-19 00:44  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing the Station Info dialog so that it will display

2004-12-18 13:06  tvrusso

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: Change configure and makefiles so

	  Not doing this before was just laziness on my part.

2004-12-18 12:43  tvrusso

	* src/db.c: Exclude own station from "DIRECTS" reply to APRSD
	  query.

2004-12-15 22:01  tvrusso

	* src/testawk.c: Minor tweaks to README.MAPS

	  Change testawk.c to remove a feature that uses command line args
	  as a dbfawk program literal --- this is why usages like   testawk
	  foo.dbfawk foo.bar (a likely guess at usage) lead to segfaults
	  instead of helpful messages.	Change usage string to reflect
	  reality.

	  I hope nobody really used that feature, but it doesn't seem
	  likely, and it was definitely the case that the segfaults were
	  confusing users.

2004-12-15 21:29  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS, src/db.c: README.MAPS: add a little explanation of
	  how to use testawk (which has the habit of segfaulting on
	  commandlines it doesn't understand)

	  db.c:  An attempt to make APRSD (Direct Station Query) responses
	  not be limited to a single line when there are too many direct
	  stations to fit on that line.

	  I have not been able to test the db.c change yet, as I can't hear
	  more than 5 stations directly, so I have to commit this and wait

	  KB7ZVA-1>APU25N,TCPIP*,qAC,KB7ZVA-1::KM5VY	:{Duh{76 (the first
	  { is technically illegal) by acking message 76, whereas prior to
	  this commit xastir would see the message ID as "Duh{7" and do:
	  KM5VY>APX142,TCPIP*::KB7ZVA-1 :ackDuh{7 causing UI-View to ack
	  message 7, and assorted other nonsense.

	  Tested only by having one instance of xastir send a malformed
	  message to another and seeing the ack of the real message ID.

2004-12-12 14:21  tvrusso

	* config/tgr2shppoly.dbfawk, src/map_shp.c: Make polygon draws
	  respect the "skip_it" step --- until now it was not possible to
	  use the dbfawk variable "display_level" to shut off drawing
	  specific polygons at large zooms.  Don't know why I hadn't
	  noticed that all that wasn't working.

	  Now that they're being paid attention to, had to tweak all the
	  display_levels in tgr2shppoly.dbfawk so things show up at
	  reasonable levels.

	  src/messages_gui.c: Updates to messenging.  We can now see queued
	  messages before they get to the transmit stage.  New button added
	  to kick the timer back to original values (to get a QSO going
	  again).  Timer value is currently sent to STDERR, but will
	  eventually be placed into the Send Message GUI as well.

2004-11-30 10:43  tvrusso

	* config/tgr2shppoly.dbfawk, config/xastir.rgb, src/color.h,
	  src/main.c: changes to coloration of shapefile tiger polygons.
	  Matches online colors a little better now.

2004-11-29 22:56  we7u

	* src/: map_tiger.c, map_cache.c, map_cache.h: More map caching
	  mods by Dan Brown, n8ysz.

2004-11-29 21:14  we7u

	* src/messages.c: Getting rid of extra message transmit before
	  timeout.  This causes us to transmit exactly MAX_TRIES times,
	  instead of MAX_TRIES + 1.

2004-11-29 12:55  we7u

	* src/: database.h, db.c, messages.c: Adding a "CANCELLED"
	  indicator to the Send Message box for those messages that made it
	  to transmit from the queue but got manually cancelled by the
	  user.

2004-11-29 11:58  we7u

	* src/: messages.h, messages.c: More RF-friendly decaying algorithm
	  for messages.  We start at 7 seconds and double the interval each
	  time.  Timeout occurs at about 2 hours if no ACK received.

2004-11-29 11:37  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Changing from LF to CRLF in lines sent to clients
	  which have connected to the server port.

2004-11-28 10:03  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Change probe for db.h to use AC_TRY_COMPILE instead
	  of AC_CHECK_HEADER, so that we can apply the same usability test
	  that is present in map_cache.c.

2004-11-27 18:56  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Making sure that lines sent out the server port
	  have "\r\n" at the end.  Before we just had '\r', which doesn't
	  correspond to the way the internet servers did it.

2004-11-25 22:10  we7u

	* README.win32: Completing the GDAL/OGR library instructions for
	  Cygwin.

2004-11-18 16:03  we7u

	* install-xastir: Changing the comments around at the end to
	  simplify things.

	  update command.

2004-11-18 12:51  we7u

	  via CVS.  For those folks challenged by the Unix way of doing
	  things.

2004-11-18 12:29  we7u

	* README.CVS, README.win32: Updating the instructions with respect
	  to the "update-xastir" script.

2004-11-18 12:23  we7u

	* update-xastir: Added a comment.

2004-11-18 10:59  we7u

	* INSTALL, README.CVS, README.win32, UPGRADE, update-xastir: Adding
	  an update-xastir script and tweaking updating instructions a bit.

2004-11-17 10:48  we7u

	* README: Added HP/UX instructions per Dan Brown, N8YSZ.  Current
	  state of HP/UX port is:  Segfaults when connected to internet
	  server, but appears to run otherwise.  Not fully tested.

2004-11-17 10:28  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing up a return that shouldn't pass back a
	  parameter.

2004-11-17 09:57  we7u

	* src/main.c: Checking for map interrupts and returning, just
	  before each call to display_file(), which is the function which
	  draws objects/tracks.

2004-11-17 09:46  we7u

	* src/: map_geo.c, map_tiger.c, util.c: Adding timeouts to libcurl
	  calls.  Wget calls already have them.

2004-11-17 09:00  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: If ImageMagick is not found, we now refuse to load
	  a .geo map unless "xpm" is found in the filename.

2004-11-17 08:11  we7u

	* src/: maps.c, maps.h, map_gdal.c, map_geo.c, map_gnis.c,
	  map_pdb.c, map_shp.c, map_tif.c, map_tiger.c, map_dos.c: Setting
	  default map layers based on the type of file.  Raster map = 0,
	  vector maps = 1000, GNIS = 99,999.

2004-11-16 14:50  we7u

	* configure.ac: Reversing the order of the map caching/Imagemagick
	  checks.  Just in case.  We've had trouble before where if
	  ImageMagick checks fail, they corrupt some of the settings for
	  the other checks, unless ImageMagick is the last of the bunch.

2004-11-16 12:09  we7u

	* FAQ: Getting rid of "localhost" on the netcat example line.
	  Redundant.

2004-11-16 10:15  we7u

	* README.win32: Tweaking the library install instructions per David
	  Flood.

2004-11-15 21:05  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Prevent a segfault when Xastir is having trouble
	  writing the map objects to file.

2004-11-15 10:05  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4: Fix of fix for fix of fix of probe for db library.

	  Amounts to removing a comment character from a critical line that
	  I'd accidentally commented out.

	  Without this fix, building xastir on a machine without a db
	  library installed will fail with an error message at link stage
	  about a missing "-ldb".  That's because the configure script
	  never reset the LIBS variable after the probe.

2004-11-15 08:52  we7u

	* src/map_cache.c: Moving more of the includes inside the #ifdef.
	  Including config.h so we get a direct answer as to whether
	  USE_MAP_CACHE is defined before we include anything else.

2004-11-15 08:22  we7u

	* src/map_cache.c: Moving a couple of includes below the
	  USE_MAP_CACHE #ifdef.  Makes it compile on systems that don't
	  have the map caching enabled.

2004-11-13 17:10  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4:
	  Handful of changes to improve probe of db for map caching.

	  1) remove attempts to probe db version 3 libraries, coz the code
	  that uses    db actually won't work unless the version is 4 or
	  above.

	  2) make the probe stop probing when it finds a library that
	  works.  Otherwise    the probe keeps overwriting the "dblib"
	  variable with "no".

	  3) comment out the attempt to probe for db_open if db_create
	  isn't found.	   That would only work if the code that uses
	  db_create were inside appropriate	ifdefs, which was probably
	  the case in the package from which the autoconf     macro was
	  obtained.

	  4) Change the comment about "FreeBSD puts this in a weird place"
	  enough    to give a reader an idea of where to look.

2004-11-13 16:54  we7u

	* src/map_cache.c: Moving the #ifdef below the #includes, so that
	  we have a chance of having the USE_MAP_CACHE variable be defined.

2004-11-13 16:12  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: A minor tweak to add "Building with
	  map caching.....: " to the list of things that are printed out at
	  the end of the configuration run.

2004-11-13 06:00  tvrusso

	* src/map_cache.c: Move the #endif for USE_MAP_CACHE to a place
	  where it actually takes out code that can't compile if
	  USE_MAP_CACHE isn't defined.

2004-11-12 16:40  shadow

	* acinclude.m4: link against the real libdb we found; use the
	  header path for it we found

2004-11-12 16:17  we7u

	* README.win32: Adding libdb and libdb-devel as necessary libs.

2004-11-12 15:50  we7u

	* INSTALL: Adding a blurb about libdb.

2004-11-12 11:31  we7u

	* README.win32: Added info about NTFS "convert.exe" getting run
	  instead of ImageMagick's "convert.exe".  Added instructions
	  written up by Randy, KK6RW, regarding auto-starting Xastir.
	  William McKeehan, KI4HDU, contributed to those instructions and
	  was the inspiration for them.

2004-11-12 10:52  we7u

	* src/: map_cache.c, map_cache.h: Moving variables to the top of
	  the blocks (for the BSD guys), changing the expire time for maps
	  to 6 months instead of one hour.

2004-11-12 10:47  we7u

	* src/map_tiger.c: Moving the variable declaration up to the top of
	  the block before those FreeBSD guys get on my case!

2004-11-12 10:24  we7u

	* acinclude.m4, src/Makefile.am: The final two pieces to enable the

2004-11-11 09:19  we7u

	* INSTALL: Updating the GDAL instructions somewhat.

2004-11-10 11:58  we7u

	* src/db.h: Removing db.h.  It has been renamed as database.h.

2004-11-10 11:58  shadow

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac:
	  berkeley db configure test. may need slight tweaking for which
	  function it tests for (db_open/db_create/solmething else)

2004-11-10 11:58  we7u

	* src/: Makefile.am, alert.h, db.c, draw_symbols.c, util.c, util.h,
	  wx.h, xastir.h: Renaming db.h to database.h in order to avoid a
	  conflict with Berkeley DB include file of the same name.

2004-11-10 11:56  we7u

	* src/database.h: Renaming db.h to database.h, in order to avoid a

2004-11-05 15:07  we7u

	* src/festival.c: Closing the file descriptor for the socket at the
	  point where the Festival connect fails.

2004-11-05 08:57  we7u

	* configure.ac: Bumping the development sources up to 1.4.2.  Just
	  released 1.4.1 stable.

2004-11-05 08:37  we7u

	* src/: igate.c, util.c: Assuring that we don't igate packets while
	  reading tactical calls in from file.

2004-11-04 12:27  we7u

	* src/: db.c, igate.c, main.c: Fixing the problem where reading in
	  a log file causes the packets to be igated to the NET.

2004-11-04 10:53  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Free'ing the hash iterators at the correct
	  points.

2004-11-02 12:37  we7u

	* src/: hashtable.c, hashtable_itr.c, hashtable_private.h: Tweaks
	  so that the GC_MALLOC/GC_FREE defines apply to the hashtable code
	  as well.

2004-11-02 07:20  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/interface.c: Making the transmit
	  and Interface->Properties long-path warning messages different.

2004-11-02 07:19  we7u

	* src/util.c: Changing one variable so that it local to where it is
	  used instead of at the top of the routine.  Changed flags to be
	  counting flags instead of booleans, so we can later use them to
	  count digipeater types.  Added some comments.

2004-11-01 12:34  we7u

	* src/util.c: Tweaking the path-check code so that trace,wide2-2
	  and wide,wide2-2 paths and similar are allowed.

2004-11-01 09:11  tvrusso

	* configure.ac, src/util.c: Add probe for strndup to configure.ac.
	  Ifdef use of strndup in src/util.c.

	  strndup is a GNU extension and not portable to non-GNU systems.

	  strdup is portable, so is used if strndup isn't available.

2004-10-30 14:13  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, interface_gui.c: Adding path checks to the
	  igate path.

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Adding another
	  string for igate path checking.

2004-10-30 13:23  tvrusso

	* README.win32: Add note to section on installing libproj and
	  libgeotiff.

	  Both of these libraries are now available directly through cygwin
	  setup, simplifying the installation.

2004-10-30 12:06  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Adding the path check code into each posit and
	  object/item transmit, at the spot where the unproto path is
	  selected.  This probably needs to be added to the igate path code
	  as well.

2004-10-29 13:15  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Another tweak by Ryan Butler, KB0JQO, to
	  check UNPROTO paths on more types of interfaces.

2004-10-29 13:00  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,

	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/interface_gui.c, src/util.c,
	  src/util.h: Tweaks by Ryan Butler, KB0JQO, to check the unproto
	  paths on interfaces for excessively long paths.  Performs the
	  path checks when you hit the OK button on the
	  Interface->Properties dialog.

2004-10-29 08:53  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Enabling tiger polygons for normal use.  Tweaked
	  the code so that the polygon reassembly only gets done if we have
	  "filled" enabled for that map.

2004-10-29 07:53  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Experimentally derived at better hash sizes
	  (twice the max size needed for any county in the state of WA).
	  Correct code now for free'ing the landmark hash.  Sped up the
	  TLID linked list code, but still testing that to make sure the
	  polygons are made correctly (it reverses the order that the line
	  segments are added to the geometryCollection).

2004-10-28 22:14  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More tweaks to the tiger code.  Still not enabled
	  for general use.

2004-10-27 10:03  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: First working version of Tiger polygon code.
	  #ifdef'ed out of the compile at present.

2004-10-27 10:02  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: Adding the hashtable files.

2004-10-27 09:58  we7u

	* src/: hashtable.c, hashtable.h, hashtable_itr.c, hashtable_itr.h,
	  hashtable_private.h: Adding generic hashtable functions.

2004-10-26 23:24  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Starting to draw some filled polygons for Tiger
	  maps.  Still not ready for prime-time so the code is still
	  disabled by an #ifdef.

2004-10-26 22:44  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More Tiger polygon code changes.  The code is
	  generating polygon geometries from the tiger data now, so the
	  next step is to start drawing them.

2004-10-26 19:55  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Implementing hash functions for the Tiger polygon
	  code.  Still #ifdef'ed out, so it won't get compiled in
	  currently.

2004-10-23 20:38  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS: Mention the Xastir_tigerpoly.py script in the place
	  where this file previously said that shapefile conversion of
	  TIGER/Line data didn't contain polygon features.

2004-10-23 15:24  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing the segfault caused by closing the Map labels
	  font dialag before closing xfontsel.	Had to put in a couple of
	  "xfontsel_query = 0" statements in the callbacks for the Map
	  labels font dialog.

2004-10-22 08:25  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Added some debug code.  It's not enabled
	  currently.

2004-10-21 19:54  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Added much of the code needed to reconstruct the
	  Tiger polygons.  The new code is commented out right now as it's
	  not quite complete and it really slows things down as well.
	  Optimization will happen AFTER the code is working.

2004-10-21 12:45  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Changed some comments.

2004-10-21 12:28  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Changed one variable name from i to ii (easier to
	  grep for).  Added some comments.

2004-10-21 01:55  tvrusso

	* config/tgr2shppoly.dbfawk: Don't display name of feature if it is
	  "None" (what some fields output by Xastir_tigerpoly.py get, a
	  feature inherited from tigerpoly.py -- haven't figured out why).

2004-10-21 01:51  tvrusso

	* config/Makefile.am, config/tgr2shppoly.dbfawk,
	  scripts/Makefile.am, scripts/Xastir_tigerpoly.py: Add python/OGR
	  script to generate polygon shapefiles from TIGER/Line data.  Add
	  dbfawk file to make them look less ugly than if there weren't
	  one.

	  Putting this in CVS merely to get it out there for community
	  hackage.

2004-10-20 21:19  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Added some comments.

2004-10-20 14:30  we7u

	  compilation by gcc 2.95.

2004-10-20 09:42  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Changes to comments only.

2004-10-20 08:37  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More messing with water layers.  Nothing major.

2004-10-19 19:17  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Commenting out the "Loading" message.

2004-10-19 18:13  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Shapefiles are working again in GDAL.

2004-10-19 11:36  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More color and line tweaks.  This change probably
	  disables Shapefiles, but SDTS and TIGER/Line files display
	  properly now.

2004-10-19 09:02  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Moving all of the color code into the
	  guess_vector_attributes function.  Later we'll be able to convert
	  this function into our map preferences system once that is fully
	  defined.  Added color to the SDTS files.

2004-10-19 07:45  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Faster determination of layer name.

2004-10-18 22:22  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Starting to support proper color scheme for
	  SDTS-format maps.  At least have contours in yellow and other
	  layers in black now.

2004-10-18 21:08  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Fixing OGR indexing so that the transform is
	  invoked every time.  Required for UTM/State-plane maps.

2004-10-18 13:17  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing default Shapefile translator back to
	  Shapelib.

2004-10-18 13:09  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Truncating the points better.  Was truncating at
	  0 for negative values, which doesn't work.  We just need to keep
	  away from the +16000/-16000 points and greater, which invoke X11
	  drawing bugs.  Truncating at zero creates dummy lines along our
	  top and left window borders.

2004-10-18 12:58  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Very weak attempt at detecting hypsography and
	  hydropraphy SDTS files to decide to color them yellow, keyed off
	  "HY"or "HP" anywhere in the full filename (that's why it is
	  weak).  Other SDTS maps get colored black currently.

2004-10-18 11:57  we7u

2004-10-15 07:56  we7u

2004-10-13 23:05  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Sped up GDAL maps:  Implemented the spatial

2004-10-13 22:57  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fix for draw_vector function.  It now rearranges the

	  it is true that --dist-bzip2 is not a valid automake option, but
	  the AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS variable doesn't generate --options for
	  automake, it has an effect on the generated makefile itself.	In
	  this case, dist-bzip2 adds a dist-bzip2 target to the makefile.

	  As far as I can tell, the folks who are having trouble with this
	  option are not in fact using automake 1.6.3 or later.  In ha2vr's
	  case it turned out he was actually using automake 1.4, even
	  though automake 1.9 was supposedly installed on his system.

	* README.MAPS: A little cleanup of the discussion involving

2004-09-19 16:39  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS, src/map_tif.c: This is a patch I've been using for
	  several months now: it allows xastir to use geotiff files that
	  are already unprojected lat/lon maps.  It simply checks the "PCS"
	  key in the geotif file, and if it's not there then the file is
	  assumed to be in lat/lon and can be used as is without
	  transformation.

	  It has no effect on maps that are not already in lat/lon, and so
	  will be invisible to anyone who hasn't needed the ability to read
	  in unprojected geotiff files.

	  README.MAPS updated to explain that gdalwarp can be used to
	  convert maps into lat/lon unprojected maps.  Also added a place
	  to find useful geotiff maps that need such conversion (FAA
	  sectionals from aviationtoolbox.org).

	  Tweaked the stuff on shapefile reprojection.	What was there were
	  verbose snippets from an email exchange between Curt and me.
	  Made them a bit shorter and more to-the-point.

	  The importing of lat/lon geotiff files is significantly slower
	  than the importing of USGS quads, because the optimized reads
	  that skip over scanlines based on zoom level don't work.  I
	  intended to figure out how to make them work, but never did the
	  work.  If folks start using this a lot and get me to bump it up
	  in priority I can revisit it.

2004-09-19 15:50  tvrusso

	* config/Makefile.am, config/gps_wpt.dbfawk, src/main.c: config:
	  New DBFAWK file for waypoints files downloaded through GPSMan.
	  Now, DBFAWK-	enabled xastir will display names of waypoints next
	  to the symbol, no matter  what directory they're put in.

	   Add gps_wpt.dbfawk file to makefile.

	  src:	make xastir write out a simple dbfawk file to go along with
	  GPSMan track	and route shapefiles.  Prior to this, these files
	  would only display in the  selected color if they were copied
	  into /usr/local/share/xastir/maps/GPS,  and would display in all
	  black if they were anywhere else.

	  Unfortunately, because we have no control over the fields created
	  by GPSMan for these shapefiles, it is not possible to stick the
	  color itself into the dbf file, as Alan had suggested in various
	  comments in the code.

	  To use these new things:   for waypoints, do nothing -- the
	  dbfawk file is generic and applies to any   GPSMan waypoint file.

	    For tracks and routes: Make sure to copy the dbfawk file when
	  you copy the
	     shapefile and dbf file to a maps directory.  Xastir will use
	  it.

	    For tracks and routes downloaded prior to this patch: the
	  dbfawk file is
	    simple, just copy one for a map of the same color.

2004-09-14 12:32  we7u

	* src/db.c: Making is_my_call() and
	  check_and_transmit_objects_items() more efficient.  Found during
	  profiling that these routines were eating up CPU.

2004-09-13 19:50  we7u

	* INSTALL, configure.ac: Adding the "--with-profiling" flag.
	  Updating docs to reflect it.

2004-09-13 12:56  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Changing label storage to a hash table instead of
	  an array, to speed things up.  Using the first character of the
	  string as the hash index.  Tried using lower 7 bits of first two
	  chars, and lower 6 bits of first two chars: Profiling showed that
	  using the first character was faster.

2004-09-13 12:54  we7u

	* src/rotated.c: Moving math into appropriate parts of loop to
	  speed it up.	Anything that is static through all iterations of a
	  loop is moved outside that loop for speed.

2004-09-10 16:09  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Implementing a cache for the most recent five
	  symbols used.  Speeds up drawing by quite a bit (found by
	  profiling).

2004-09-10 12:26  we7u

	* src/main.c: More speedups found by profiling.  Checking for new
	  gps map only once per second now, updating the stations count on
	  the status line once per second instead of continuously.

2004-09-10 09:19  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding some Cygwin-specific usleep's in UpdateTime()
	  in order to reduce CPU usage on those systems.

2004-09-10 08:49  we7u

	* src/awk.c: Sped up awk_find_sym() a bit.

2004-09-10 08:37  we7u

	* src/rotated.c: Sped up font rotation by moving some
	  floating-point math outside the inner loop.

2004-09-10 08:27  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Fixing a minor compiler warning.

2004-09-09 20:37  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fixing a bug I introduced earlier today while
	  speeding up map indexing.

2004-09-09 12:59  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Speeding up the maps.c:index_retrieve() function.
	  Making it more efficient.  Perhaps the next step would be to turn
	  it into a hash lookup, but that would require changing perhaps
	  several other routines to match.

2004-09-09 09:11  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started: Adding another note about callpass.

2004-09-09 08:06  we7u

2004-09-08 12:22  we7u

	* INSTALL: Adding a section on checking for memory leaks.

2004-09-08 10:48  we7u

2004-09-07 08:39  we7u

	* src/festival.c: Adding some usleep() function calls for the case
	  where we can't open a socket to Festival, so that we don't spin
	  our wheels too fast trying to open sockets.

2004-09-06 21:06  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Done the body, just "whats new" section
	  left.

2004-09-06 18:44  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixes for the Filled and Automaps columns in Map
	  Chooser->Properties dialog.

2004-09-04 23:24  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Updating helpfile some more, still have
	  last 1/3rd to go over and "whats new" section to write. FIXMEs up
	  for grabs; and if anyone otherwise wants to help let me know.

2004-09-03 08:16  we7u

	* src/db.c: Drawing symbol after we draw circles and other items.
	  Trying to keep the text on top so that it is more readable.

2004-09-02 22:37  we7u

	* src/db.c: Moving the weather info to the top of the Station Info
	  dialog, for the cases where we have weather info stored.  The
	  weather info is the most important info for that station in that
	  case, so it should be readable without scrolling.  Stations
	  without weather data are unaffected by this change.

2004-09-02 20:19  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixed a small bug in positionless weather decoding
	  where it wasn't decoding course/speed fields.  We now take
	  another look for course/speed if either of them are empty.
	  Before both of them had to be empty before we tried another type
	  of parsing for them.	Did the and->or conversion in several
	  places in extract_weather(), so the change affects more than just
	  positionless weather packets.

2004-09-02 13:58  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys: Another tweak from Henk & Han.

2004-09-02 11:36  we7u

2004-09-02 10:51  we7u

	* FAQ: Updating the locale-specific answers.

2004-09-02 10:45  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing the locale for numbers to "C".  We require
	  this in order to be able to write and parse our config files and
	  .geo files properly when the LC_NUMERIC or LANG environment
	  variables are set to something else.	This affects the printf and
	  scanf sorts of functions.

2004-09-02 07:49  we7u

	* src/: main.c, xa_config.c: Bumping the max timeout for tigermaps
	  from 120 to 180 seconds since so many people are getting timeouts
	  with it.

2004-09-01 12:34  we7u

2004-08-31 09:08  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Updating helpfile for release, about 1/3rd
	  done.

	* config/language-Italian.sys: Updates by Alessandro Frigeri,
	  IK0YUP.  Thanks!

2004-08-30 08:49  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Adding a terminating zero to the AGWPE packets
	  in port_read() instead of in parse_agwpe_packet().

2004-08-30 08:28  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Adding a string terminator to the end of the
	  AGWPE raw packets before we start processing them.  This keeps
	  portions of previously received packets from getting appended to
	  our current string during our processing.

2004-08-30 07:38  we7u

	* README.win32: Changing to Henk de Groot's optimized Festival
	  install instructions.

2004-08-28 15:43  we7u

	* README.win32: Added Festival instructions for Win32 courtesy of
	  Tom Russo.  Thanks!

2004-08-27 13:09  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fix for high CPU-usage when time skips backwards.
	  This fix causes Xastir to sleep a bit in the UpdateTime() loop
	  until time catches up again, thereby avoiding the problem.  It
	  also dumps a message out to STDERR as it goes into/out of this
	  mode.

2004-08-27 07:44  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Changed the gdal output on startup to show only
	  those map formats that have been enabled in Xastir AND are
	  supported by the GDAL library that we're compiled against.

2004-08-27 07:16  we7u

	* config/language-German.sys: Tweaks by Rolf Bleher, DK7IN.
	  Thanks!

2004-08-26 18:07  shadow

	* configure.ac: update libgeotiff/libtiff/libproj configure tests
	  such that 1) libproj is checked for only once 2) libtiff is used
	  if found when testing for libgeotiff

	  revised test from Tom Russo KM5VY and tested on MacOS X and
	  Linux.

2004-08-26 14:03  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing the code so that snow can be parsed out of a

	  parsed/deleted from the string.

2004-08-26 11:09  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Fix for high-CPU bug when malformed NWS weather

2004-08-21 17:01  we7u

	* src/: db.c, util.c, util.h: More fixes for xastir_snprintf size

	* src/: db.c, geocoder_gui.c, gps.c, hostname.c, igate.c,
	  interface.c, maps.c: Cleaning up the size parameter for a bunch
	  of xastir_snprintf calls.

2004-08-20 13:50  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fix for bad longitude for your own station.

2004-08-20 11:38  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing problem with truncated comment/status strings.
	  Was setting the length in the xastir_snprintf() call to the
	  length of the pointer instead of the length of the malloc'ed
	  string buffer.

2004-08-20 10:27  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added a comment.

2004-08-20 10:25  we7u

	* src/: awk.c, geo-find.c: Reformatting of geo-find.c.	Added
	  comment to both files.

2004-08-20 10:22  we7u

	* src/db.c: Moving ptr into the block where it is used.

2004-08-20 10:19  kd6zwr

	* src/db.c: Moving a declaration up to the top to allow it to be

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Reducing the
	  resolution on the snow reports, as they are only reported by

2004-08-19 21:06  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, awk.c, db.c, geo-find.c, igate.c, interface.c,
	  messages_gui.c, util.c, view_message_gui.c, wx.c, x_spider.c:
	  More on the strcat/strcpy/strncpy reduction/elimination.  I think
	  this finishes off all the strcat/strcpy calls, and there are only
	  24 strncpy calls left in the code.

2004-08-19 13:10  we7u

2004-08-18 23:31  we7u

	* src/: geo.h, gps.h, main.h, messages.h, wx.h, xastir.h:

	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/db.h, src/list_gui.c,
	  src/maps.c, src/wx.c: Changed wx_snow to be inches instead of
	  1/100 inch.  We now ghost the weather info (mostly) separately
	  from posit info.  Got rid of "<br>" from track logs read in from
	  findu.com.  Fixed realloc's in maps.c so that they won't cause a
	  memory leak if they fail.  Fixed Peet Bros. complete mode
	  decoding so that the proper wind speed is parsed.  Fix by Matt
	  Werner, kb0kqa, for the 3-hour barometric pressure reading for
	  Peet Bros. complete mode parsing.

2004-08-17 17:17  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changed formatting, added comments.  No code changes.

2004-08-17 09:41  we7u

	  it looks good.

2004-08-16 17:51  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing the "Move" function so that you can drag/drop
	  objects/items that are right on top of each other.  The selection
	  dialog will pop up so you can choose which one to move.

2004-08-14 09:43  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing object/item generation so that a space is
	  prefixed to the comment field only in the case where multipoint
	  polygons are present.  The space is necessary in order to parse
	  multipoint objects properly, but is not desired for other
	  objects/items where it would limit the extent of the comment.

2004-08-12 17:26  we7u

	* src/map_gnis.c: Update to GNIS search code for new pipe-delimited

2004-08-12 17:25  we7u

	* INSTALL, README.MAPS, help/help-English.dat: Updates to the docs

2004-08-12 13:46  kd6zwr

	* src/x_spider.c: Moved some declarations up to the top of

	  my gcc 2.96 under linux).

2004-08-12 13:00  we7u

	* src/map_gnis.c: Updating the GNIS map code to handle the latest
	  pipe-delimited files from the USGS.  Still need to update the
	  search code, but the display code appears to work fine now.

2004-08-12 10:03  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added some debug code for tracking down errant
	  raw packets in the AGWPE code.

2004-08-11 13:15  we7u

	  packets.

2004-08-11 10:40  we7u

	* src/: main.c, x_spider.c: Tweaks by Tom Russo for FreeBSD

2004-08-10 12:51  we7u

	* src/: main.c, x_spider.c, x_spider.h: Code that changes the

	  doesn't work for "top" listings.

2004-08-09 11:32  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Disabling the Nagle algorithm and enabling
	  SO_KEEPALIVE for the server port connections.

2004-08-07 11:12  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Modified AGWPE parsing routine and associated
	  code.  We've now turned off "monitor" mode and turned on "raw"
	  mode in AGWPE.  The "raw" packets get thrown into our standard
	  KISS decoding routines, which gives us the possibility of
	  supporting OpenTrac (a binary protocol) and digipeating on AGWPE
	  ports in the future.	The "monitor" mode decoding has been left
	  for now, but later on we'll probably delete it.  Also:  Added
	  output to STDERR for the AGWPE server version and for the port
	  descriptions.

2004-08-06 12:57  we7u

	* src/db.c: Change to comment.	No code changes.

2004-08-06 09:29  we7u

2004-08-05 13:02  we7u

	* src/: db.c, festival.c, main.c, interface.c, sound.c, util.c,
	  util.h: Re-wrote the agwpe parsing code.  It should be more
	  bulletproof now, but still has some debug stuff in it for NWS_
	  and NWS- messages.  Fixed a segfault caused by one of the new
	  strncpy() functions that I switched to in util.c:spell_it_out().

	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c: Changing the Modify
	  Object/Item dialogs so that you must adopt an object/item that
	  you don't own before you're allowed to delete it.  Adopting or
	  Modifying someone else's object causes you to transmit it as a
	  live object owned by you.  After that, you may delete it.  If the
	  client that previously owned it saw your live object, it'll know
	  that you own it and that you can delete it.  Without this
	  adoption process, UI-View32 clients will hold on to an object
	  that you're trying to kill.

2004-08-04 12:07  we7u

	  catch all possibilities.  Now it should be.

2004-08-03 12:57  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changed one sizeof() to a strlen() for emergency
	  messages.  Fixing object/item timing intervals so that if the
	  timing slider is reduced, the max interval is reduced for already
	  existing objects as well.

2004-07-26 17:08  we7u

	* src/: db.c, x_spider.c: Per-client authentication for the

	  connect/disconnect, and each successful authentication.
	  Non-authenticated clients can talk to each other and the server,
	  and can receive data from the server, but can't sent anything

2004-07-26 14:02  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Changing the authentication comments slightly for
	  x_spider.

2004-07-26 13:59  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Adding client authentication to the x_spider

	  "master" Xastir instance if igating -> Net is enabled.

2004-07-23 09:57  we7u

	* src/db.c: Ignore case when comparing newly received
	  comment/status strings with previously received ones, to decide
	  which ones to throw into the list.  With a case-sensitive
	  compare, we were getting two instances of similar comment/status
	  strings cluttering up our lists, when it was really the same info

2004-07-21 18:56  we7u

	* src/: Makefile.am, db.c, igate.c, interface.c, main.c, main.h,
	  x_spider.c, x_spider.h: Adding a listener socket for multiple
	  clients.  Currently this must be enabled by uncommenting a
	  #define near the top of main.c.  Adds a listening socket at port
	  2023 which allows any number of clients to connect.  Spawns a
	  listener for each active client, kills them when the client
	  disconnects.	All packets received or transmitted by Xastir go to
	  these clients, all packets sent by the clients are received by
	  Xastir and by all of the other connected clients.  "telnet
	  localhost 2023" to test out the functionality after compiling in
	  the server support.

2004-07-21 11:38  gstueve

2004-07-20 11:41  we7u

	* src/db.c: Sorting and display of status/comment records by
	  date/time.

2004-07-20 11:14  we7u

	* src/db.h: Bumping max status/comment lines per station from 10 to
	  20.  Am testing with 50 locally to see whether bumping it up more
	  will seriously affect memory usage.  Depending on the results,
	  may bump these numbers up even more.

2004-07-19 19:42  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,

	  Adding date/timestamps to Status and Comment records.

2004-07-19 14:17  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h, db.c, db.h: Moving a couple of define's
	  to the .h files and increasing the number of alerts and messages
	  that we allocate when we run out.  This hopefully will help to
	  keep the number of large allocations down plus keep the larger
	  allocations from ending up at the very end of the heap.  If we
	  keep a small increment, we realloc() more often plus the large
	  blocks will end up closer to the end of the heap, meaning we
	  won't be able to reduce our memory impact much later.

2004-07-19 09:13  we7u

	* config/: tnc-startup.aea, tnc-startup.d700, tnc-startup.kpc2,
	  tnc-startup.kpc3, tnc-startup.paccomm, tnc-startup.sys,
	  tnc-startup.thd7, tnc-startup.tnc2-ui: Adding "HID off" where it
	  was missed.  Some TNC's may require slightly different commands
	  for this.  I don't have them to test with so I'll have to wait
	  for users to let me know the proper commands.

2004-07-16 11:27  we7u

	* configure.ac, src/alert.c, src/db.c, src/main.c, src/map_gdal.c,
	  src/xastir.h: Adding support for "libgc", which is a
	  Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collection library.  The advantage
	  for us is that it can find/report memory leaks.  Install it, then
	  add "--with-libgc" to the configure line to compile it in.  It
	  will report memory leaks on the console.  This patch fixes two
	  leaks found by libgc, plus changes the increments used for
	  relloc'ing alerts and messages.

2004-07-15 14:32  we7u

	* src/: awk.c, db.c, dbfawk.c, igate.c, main.c, map_gdal.c,

	* src/messages.c: Reformatting to take out tabs.

2004-07-15 10:09  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changed some debug code that is used to test expire

2004-07-15 08:29  gstueve

	* src/messages.c: Make sure to look for Special groups and safety
	  check group names.

2004-07-14 14:07  we7u

	* FAQ, INSTALL, acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Motif detection tweaks

2004-07-14 12:48  we7u

	* src/db.c: Reformatting and comment changes.  No code changes.

2004-07-14 12:13  we7u

	* src/db.c: Better code for drawing callsign at each trackpoint.
	  This draws the callsign at every single point.

2004-07-14 09:31  we7u

	* src/main.c: An attempt to fix the menu GPS Status so that it

	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/main.c, src/main.h,
	  src/xa_config.c: Added a new button to the Station Filter dialog:
	  "Label All Points".	Doesn't actually label _ALL_ trackpoints,
	  but labels most of them with the callsign.  This is helpful to
	  identify whose tracks belong to who.

2004-07-13 07:54  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, db.c, db.h, list_gui.c, main.c, main.h,
	  messages.c, messages.h, messages_gui.c, track_gui.c, util.c:
	  Combined MAX_CALL and MAX_CALLSIGN defines into MAX_CALLSIGN,
	  reduced the size of it from 20 chars.  Added MAX_COMMENT_LINES
	  and MAX_STATUS_LINES, currently set to 10 each, which limit how
	  many unique status/comment lines are saved per station.  Added
	  MAX_TACTICAL_CALL in order to separate that parameter from
	  MAX_CALLSIGN, as the tactical call needs to be longer but didn't
	  want to waste the memory for all callsigns by making them all
	  long.  Changed the alert memory allocation from 100 alert blocks
	  to 25 alert blocks (finer grained malloc's).	Added more
	  comments.

2004-07-09 14:11  we7u

	* src/main.c: Throwing Base-91 Compressed APRS packets into our
	  decoding instead of standard APRS packets.  This keeps the
	  resolution that the RINO's are capable of.  Doesn't affect how
	  the Object packets are transmitted: For that setting refer to the
	  toggle on the File->Configure->Defaults dialog.

2004-07-09 10:32  we7u

	* src/main.c: Better timestamp for RINO-derived APRS Objects.
	  Issues:  currently sends localtime instead of UTC, plus the
	  gpstrans files we're getting the timestamp from appear to have
	  the download time/date instead of the waypoint creation
	  time/date.  These need to be fixed at some point.

2004-07-09 08:19  rzg

	* src/alert.c: Fixed read of unitialized data according to
	  valgrind.

2004-07-08 16:34  rzg

	* src/main.c: Fixed comparisions of unitialized variables, and
	  another small bug.

2004-07-08 14:49  we7u

	* src/main.c: Initializing some variables as they are defined.

2004-07-08 14:49  we7u

	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c, src/main.h,
	  src/xa_config.c: Implemented auto-download capability for the
	  RINO waypoints.  A new slider added to the
	  File->Configure->Timing dialog.  A setting of 0 disables the
	  function.  Anything else invokes GPSMan at the interval selected,
	  downloading all waypoints from a RINO, and creating APRS objects
	  out of those that have "APRS" as the beginning four characters of
	  the waypoint name.

2004-07-08 08:50  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c: Initial support for
	  Garmin RINO "contact" waypoints.  A new entry on the Interface
	  menu allows snagging waypoints from a RINO.  Any that begin with
	  the letters "APRS" will have those four letters removed and then
	  a standard APRS object is created from them and starts
	  transmitting out from Xastir over APRS.  We're using
	  non-compressed Objects so that they will be visible on Kenwood
	  displays, at the expense of throwing away some of the position
	  resolution.  The menu link-in may change, as we'll eventually go
	  to an automatic poll scheme of the RINO instead of this manual
	  operation.  Currently requires a connected RINO on a serial port
	  and GPSMan support compiled into Xastir.

2004-07-07 11:15  we7u

	* INSTALL: Tweaked the instructions for GDAL ever so slightly.

2004-07-07 09:30  we7u

	* configure.ac: Added a comment from Tom Russo.  We need to make
	  some changes to the Motif detect so that we're assured we have
	  working headers/libraries before we get to the compile stage.

2004-07-06 15:29  we7u

	* configure.ac: Replacing our Motif search code with better code
	  from the "vim" project.  This code is purported to find the most
	  recent variant of Motif on the system and use that, if there's
	  more than one on the system.	It also looks quite a few more
	  places for the libraries/headers than our old code.

2004-07-06 11:23  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added comments.

2004-07-02 13:19  we7u

2004-06-30 10:54  we7u

	* src/: db.h, db.c: Moved multipoints into a separate record,

2004-06-29 20:45  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h: Tweaks to significantly reduce memory usage.

2004-06-29 12:42  we7u

2004-06-24 13:08  we7u

	* src/main.c: Erasing box after Measure operation.

2004-06-24 13:00  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Removing tac-call capability for
	  objects/items.  The saving/restoring of these on startup is a
	  problem.  Perhaps we can add the functionality back in later for
	  these, but probably only if we own the objects/items ourselves.
	  Even then, deleting the objects/items needs to be looked at
	  carefully.

2004-06-24 12:29  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, main.c, util.c: Fix for Move function.  Also

	  was right all along.	The user that is experiencing difficulties
	  with a KAM+ must have some other sort of problem.

2004-06-23 11:10  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Serial TNC AUX GPS interfaces weren't parsing
	  GPS data out of the datastream.  This should fix it.	More
	  testing to come.

2004-06-23 11:05  we7u

	* src/main.c: Comment changes.

2004-06-23 10:30  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing one debug printf()

2004-06-22 13:44  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing the code so that the SWAP_MOUSE_BUTTONS #ifdef
	  works properly again.

2004-06-22 12:36  we7u

	* src/db.c: Adding tactical call button to Station Info dialog.
	  This is required for cases where multiple calls are near the
	  pointer, else we can't assign tactical calls.

2004-06-22 10:41  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixed a memory leak in the expire routines, where
	  status data was not getting free'd.

2004-06-22 10:20  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing bug in expire code introduced by newly-added
	  tactical call code.

2004-06-21 14:10  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c, main.h, xa_config.c: Adding a toggle flag for
	  selecting only stations with tactical callsigns.

2004-06-21 11:03  we7u

	* src/: db.c, util.c: Restoring of tactical calls from file when
	  Xastir starts up or after all stations are cleared.  Dummy
	  records are created which then get coupled to the real info when
	  the station gets heard on the air.  Also tweaked the expire code
	  so that stations with tac-calls don't get expired.  They should
	  still get cleared from the screen, but the station and all it's
	  original data, including tac-call, should appear again when the
	  station re-appears on frequency.  That new addition to the expire
	  code is not tested fully yet.

2004-06-21 09:08  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c, util.c, util.h: Logging of tactical calls to
	  disk.  Added Clear Tactical Calls and Clear Tactical History menu
	  options.  Restore of tactical calls from disk at startup is not
	  coded yet.

2004-06-18 22:24  we7u

	* src/db.c: Adding the callsign or the object/item name as a label
	  in the Assign Tactical Call dialog, so that we know what we're
	  renaming.

2004-06-18 13:32  we7u

	* src/db.c: Instant update when changing a tactical call.

2004-06-18 13:01  we7u

	* src/db.c: Minor tweaks to the tactical call stuff.  Allows 19
	  chars now for the name.

2004-06-18 12:28  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/db.h, src/main.c:
	  Implementing Tactical Calls.	Added to the right-click mouse
	  menu.

2004-06-18 10:09  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Comment changes.

2004-06-18 10:07  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Mostly comment changes.  Added "Counts" to the
	  generic measurements table ( units[] ).

2004-06-18 08:46  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changing some comments.

2004-06-18 08:38  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Minor comment change.

2004-06-18 08:35  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Minor tweaks to the OpenTrac classification
	  messages.

2004-06-18 08:24  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Adding in catch-all clauses for OpenTrac
	  elements that are new or not-yet-implemented.

2004-06-18 08:03  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Putting in more dummy routines for the
	  unimplemented OpenTrac element decoding.

2004-06-18 07:30  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing the AUX-TNC type so that it actually tries to
	  parse the GPS sentences.  It didn't appear to do that with the
	  earlier code, while other types of interfaces did parse them.

2004-06-18 06:51  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Adding parsing for more OpenTrac elements.  Not
	  much is done with the data yet, but the placeholders are there
	  now.	Added better reporting for various classes of unknown
	  OpenTrac element types also.

2004-06-18 00:08  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added some comments.

2004-06-17 16:33  we7u

	* src/interface.c: More very minor OpenTrac tweaks.

2004-06-17 15:46  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Minor tweaks so that the OpenTrac comment field
	  gets cleared before we process each piece, plus adding a space
	  before the displayname part of the OpenTrac comment.

2004-06-17 15:11  we7u

	* FAQ: Added another question/answer about problems caused by the
	  LANG environment variable setting.

2004-06-17 12:28  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Limiting the comment field on the converted
	  OpenTrac packets to 40 chars, which is the max for a Base-91
	  compressed APRS packet.

2004-06-17 12:18  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Converting strcat() to strncat() functions in
	  the OpenTrac routines.

2004-06-17 12:03  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changed some comments.  No code changes.

2004-06-17 11:10  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Higher-resolution OpenTrac positioning.  We now
	  convert to Base-91 Compressed APRS packets before throwing them
	  into our standard decoding.  This should give us 1/100 sec
	  lat/long resolution, instead of the 60' resolution we had before.
	  This new code is untested as of yet.

2004-06-17 10:46  we7u

	* src/: util.c, xastir.h: Adding a higher-resolution lat/long
	  format, so we can make better use of OpenTrac resolution.

2004-06-17 08:06  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changing from issuing the "conv" command to
	  issuing the "k" command to get the TNC into converse mode.  One
	  european TNC doesn't implement the "conv" command.

2004-06-16 16:27  we7u

	* config/: tnc-startup.d700, tnc-startup.thd7: Adding TXD settings
	  to the Kenwood startup files.

	* src/util.c: Changing one debug fprintf.

2004-06-14 13:40  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Removing an error messaging having to do with
	  the tnc-start/stop META tag.	This error message gets thrown out
	  at odd times if you happen to have META in a comment in those
	  file.  Not needed.

2004-06-14 13:14  we7u

	* README.win32: Liblcms is now a Cygwin package, so changing the

	* config/Makefile.am: Adding the new D700 start/stop files.

2004-06-11 12:44  we7u

	* config/: tnc-startup.d700, tnc-stop.d700: Adding files that David
	  Flood, KD7MYC, came up with to start/top a Kenwood D700A and put
	  it into the proper modes in each case.

2004-06-10 19:26  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Tweaks to allow more control in the
	  tnc-startup.sys file.  Adds a pause and a no-ctrl-C capability.

	  tnc-startup.sys: More PID filtering stuff.

2004-06-04 12:42  we7u

	* config/: tnc-startup.aea, tnc-startup.kam, tnc-startup.kpc3,
	  tnc-startup.paccomm, tnc-startup.pico, tnc-startup.sys: Adding
	  PID filtering so that only 0xf0 PID's make it through in converse
	  mode (APRS packets).

2004-06-04 10:36  we7u

	* src/fcc_data.c: Fix by Tom Russo.

2004-06-04 10:20  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.kam: Adding PID OFF.

2004-06-04 09:53  we7u

	  don't show up in converse/monitor mode.

2004-06-03 22:49  we7u

	* src/main.c: Zoom-in box tweaks.  These prevent the vectors from
	  being drawn over again if a screen update has happened.  Keeps

	  coordinate conversion.

2004-06-02 11:19  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding a visible selection outline to the zoom-in
	  function.  The outline updates once per second currently and

	* configure.ac: Adding Davis stuff.

2004-06-02 09:40  we7u

	* Makefile.am: Adding Davis directory.

2004-06-02 09:38  we7u

	  xastir/src/Davis/src to xastir/Davis/src

2004-06-02 09:37  we7u

	* Davis/: AUTHORS, COPYING, ChangeLog, INSTALL, Makefile.am, NEWS,
	  README, bootstrap.sh, configure.ac: Moved these from
	  xastir/src/Davis to xastir/Davis

2004-06-01 20:28  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: Removing Davis from the list of subdirectories
	  for now.

2004-06-01 15:49  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: Tweaks to include the Davis code in the released
	  tgz files.

2004-05-30 22:34  we7u

	* src/: dbfawk.c, map_shp.c: More Tom Russo fixes, also removing
	  some debug code that I added earlier.

2004-05-30 18:28  rzg

	* INSTALL, README.MAPS, help/help-English.dat: Updates to all the
	  docs, some more README.MAPS cleanups/updates.

2004-05-28 17:45  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Correcting what I submitted earlier to match what
	  Tom Russo sent me.  My oops.

2004-05-28 16:02  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, map_shp.c: Tom Russo's tweak to allow red flag
	  alerts in their current transmitted form to be displayed by
	  Xastir.  Thanks!

2004-05-28 15:44  we7u

	* symbols/Makefile.am: Adding new red_flag.xbm file to the mix.

2004-05-28 15:43  we7u

	* symbols/red_flag.xbm: New warning by Tom Russo.

2004-05-28 12:23  we7u

	* config/: nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsfz_ddmmyy.dbfawk,
	  nwsmzddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsozddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsw_ddmmyy.dbfawk,
	  nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk: More tweaks from Tom Russo.  This one is
	  intended to supply a "BOGUS" default value for the key if the
	  shapefile has NULL entries.

2004-05-28 12:16  we7u

	* src/main.c: Mostly comment changes.  Also removing the exit when
	  Festival can't be connected to (which I don't think worked
	  anyway).

2004-05-28 12:03  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Changed an exit() to a return() for the case where
	  dbfawk fails.

2004-05-28 12:03  we7u

	* src/: hostname.c, sound.c: Added some comments.

2004-05-28 11:34  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Comment change.

2004-05-28 11:09  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Here's a fix for the missing weather alert
	  problem, when using dbfawk.  Turns out the latest zone file from
	  NOAA has an unexpected mostly-NULL entry for shape 144, which
	  caused our compare to match on that shape in all cases.  It's
	  definitely an incorrect shapefile entry, but it caused a problem
	  in our code as well which needed to be fixed.  We now check again
	  using the title length if we got a match due to the key length
	  being 0.

2004-05-28 07:48  we7u

	* config/: nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsfz_ddmmyy.dbfawk,
	  nwsmzddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsozddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsw_ddmmyy.dbfawk,
	  nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk: Tweaks by Tom Russo to reset fill_style in

	* src/map_shp.c: Adding some more "free" stuff before yet another
	  return.

2004-05-26 09:11  we7u

2004-05-24 21:18  we7u

	* src/: dbfawk.c, map_shp.c: Adding comments/printf's regarding
	  allocation/deallocation of memory.

2004-05-24 21:11  we7u

	* src/: awk.c, testawk.c: Adding comments regarding allocations and
	  free'ing of memory.

2004-05-24 18:55  we7u

	* src/: dbfawk.c, map_shp.c: More memory leak fixes for dbfawk.
	  Getting better!

2004-05-24 14:53  we7u

	* src/: map_shp.c, dbfawk.c: Adding some free() statements to exit
	  points in map_shp.c, to de-allocate memory that was allocated
	  earlier in the function via dbfawk calls.

2004-05-24 11:02  gstueve

	* src/main.c: Actually maintain count of visible alerts on screen
	  for increasing alert count.

2004-05-24 10:51  we7u

	  messages.

2004-05-23 17:01  n2ygk

	  shapefile.

2004-05-22 12:42  we7u

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Mods by Tom Russo to allow the

2004-05-20 14:46  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Closing a small memory leak in the dbfawk stuff.
	  More to come.  Thanks to Tom Russo for finding this one.

2004-05-19 16:23  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing the local station so that compressed posits
	  turn off ambiguity.

2004-05-19 16:08  we7u

	* INSTALL, README.MAPS, configure.ac, xastir.spec.in: Making dbfawk
	  be compiled in by default.  Added --without-* flags for all of
	  the optional libraries so that they can be disabled.	Made
	  geotiff compilation dependent on libproj being present.  Made
	  dbfawk compilation dependent on shapelib and pcre being present.
	  The tests for the libraries are skipped entirely if the proper
	  --without-* flag is passed to configure.

2004-05-19 09:05  we7u

	* config/Makefile.am: Adding the fire alert dbfawk file to the
	  distribution.

	  shapefile.

2004-05-18 13:28  we7u

	* config/nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk: Added a commented line which works
	  with fire zone files.  Can't add it in yet as it appears to be
	  mutually exclusive with the other line before it which works for
	  regular zone files.

2004-05-18 13:26  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Added a comment.

2004-05-18 12:54  we7u

	* README.MAPS, src/map_shp.c, src/maps.c: Adding support for fire
	  zone maps.  Works now for non-dbfawk compiles, but need to get
	  dbfawk working with them as well.  The WXSVR should eventually
	  start sending these types of alerts to us on firenet.

2004-05-18 09:42  we7u

	* src/db.c: Had to move the variable declarations up in the code
	  block, else it fails compile on FreeBSD.  Thanks to Tom Russo for
	  this fix.

2004-05-17 13:06  we7u

	* src/db.c: A small tweak to make the FCC/RAC lookup for
	  objects/items look at the FROM callsign instead of the
	  object/item names.  Now we can look up who is sending the objects
	  in our database.

2004-05-17 12:44  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing the weather alert by "Station Info" lookups so
	  that it works for more objects from the weather server.

2004-05-17 11:45  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/wx.h, src/wx_gui.c:
	  Adding the capability to finger the WXSVR if an object/item and
	  has "WXSVR" in the path.  This is from a new button "Fetch NWS
	  Alert" in the Station Info dialog.  It takes the place of the
	  FCC/RAC button if the above conditions are met.

2004-05-13 10:17  we7u

	* configure.ac: Moving the ImageMagick check so that it is the
	  absolute last check, so that it doesn't mess up the GDAL check
	  either.  Added comments stating that the IM check should stay as
	  the last check.

2004-05-13 09:51  we7u

	* configure.ac: Moving the ImageMagick test to later in the
	  configuration.  It appears to mess up the tests for other
	  libraries if it fails.  Now only the GDAL test is below it.

2004-05-12 13:49  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Additional comments.

2004-05-12 12:33  we7u

	* scripts/overlay.pl: Correcting the math for lat/long.

2004-05-12 11:56  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Making sure that the AGWPE path is upper-case.

2004-05-12 11:45  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Fixing a bug in AGWPE path for objects/items.
	  This bug was caused by a different use of variables between the
	  output_aprs_data() and output_my_aprs_data() functions, and then
	  copying code from one to the other without changing the
	  variables.  Variable names are now more common between them, so
	  this problem should be less likely to occur in the future.

2004-05-12 09:44  we7u

	* scripts/overlay.pl: Changes to comments.

2004-05-12 09:16  we7u

	* scripts/: overlay.pl, Makefile.am: Adding overlay.pl, which
	  creates either Xastir log file format or Xastir object.log format
	  files from CSV files.  Used to create object overlays (actually
	  APRS Items in this case) out of spreadsheet data.

2004-05-11 10:07  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a comment about an error caused by line-wrap
	  in the Shapelib Makefile.

2004-05-10 13:51  we7u

	* src/: main.h, main.c: Adding #ifdef's for "OLD_PTHREADS", which
	  knock out the SIGUSR1 handler if "OLD_PTHREADS" is defined in
	  "main.h".

2004-05-10 12:33  we7u

	* src/db.c: Proper code for randomizing the object/item transmit
	  times a bit.

2004-05-10 09:39  we7u

	* scripts/Makefile.am: Adding a few of the newer scripts to the
	  install portion.

2004-05-08 19:54  we7u

	* src/: main.c, db.c: Tweaking the object/item timing to make sure
	  that any changes to an object cause the object to immediately go
	  to the initial state of the decay algorithm.

2004-05-08 18:55  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing the random number modulus operations for
	  transmitting objects/items.  It appears however that the rand()
	  and random() functions are broken on this system, always
	  returning 0.

2004-05-07 14:09  we7u

	* src/db.c: Reducing the randomizing of object/item TX times from
	  33% of interval to 20% of interval.

2004-05-07 13:45  we7u

	* src/db.c: Randomizing object/item transmit a bit so that they
	  don't get transmitted together when restarting with active
	  objects/items.  This causes them to diverse fairly well after
	  about the third transmit iteration.

2004-05-07 13:21  we7u

	* src/util.c: Adding some comments.

2004-05-07 11:02  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fix for objects/items:  If we're using the name of one
	  that has already been killed, we now delete the old record
	  completely before creating the new one.  This keeps us from
	  drawing tracklines from one to the other or keeping info that
	  doesn't apply to the new object/item.

2004-05-07 09:19  we7u

	* src/util.c: Fixing the logging of objects/items.  There were
	  problems with removing spaces from Items which made them not
	  found in the search, and problems with comments in front of lines
	  in the log file.

2004-05-07 09:16  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h: Comment changes.  No code changes.

2004-05-06 16:27  we7u

	* src/messages.c: Reducing the initial time interval between
	  transmitted messages from 15 to 7 seconds.

2004-05-06 16:19  we7u

	* src/: db.h, messages.c: Minor comment changes.

2004-05-06 14:40  we7u

	* src/: db.h, db.c, main.c: Implementing the decaying algorithm for
	  timing of object/item transmits, similar to how Bob Bruninga does
	  it in aprsDOS.  Also added a segfault fix for moving Items (same
	  fix as done earlier for moving Objects).

2004-05-04 10:59  we7u

	* INSTALL: Bumping rev. numbers for some of the optional libraries.

2004-05-03 11:58  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Added some geodesy links.

2004-04-30 13:27  we7u

	* INSTALL: Adding more URL's to lists of internet servers.

2004-04-29 15:30  we7u

	* FAQ: Adding a section describing the fixes for the CVS hostname
	  change at SourceForge.

2004-04-28 14:43  shadow

	* configure.ac: Test for linker support of -Wl,--no-keep-memory
	  rather than assuming it's safe everywhere; MacOS 10.3.x doesn't
	  support it.

2004-04-27 09:23  we7u

	* INSTALL: Added instructions for connecting to an internet server
	  plus a pointer to the current list of servers.

2004-04-26 12:31  we7u

	* README.win32: Additions by Henk de Groot.  Thanks!

2004-04-26 11:14  we7u

	* INSTALL, README.win32: Shapelib links updates, thanks to Wes
	  Johnston for pointing this out.

2004-04-23 10:46  we7u

	* src/interface.c: OpenTrac patch by J. Lance Cotton, KJ5O.
	  Thanks!

2004-04-23 10:35  we7u

	* src/igate.c: Refusing to gate OpenTrac packets (which have been
	  converted to APRS-format by Xastir) to/from RF or the INET.

2004-04-21 16:01  we7u

	* src/main.c: Working version of the new Center & Zoom mouse menu
	  function.

2004-04-21 14:59  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c: Starting to add a new
	  mouse menu entry:  "Center & Zoom".  Non-functional so far but
	  won't take much more work to finish it.

2004-04-15 14:19  we7u

	* README.win32: An update to the link-step memory-hog note.

2004-04-15 10:12  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a note about the link-stage being very memory
	  hungry/taking a lot of time to complete on Cygwin.

2004-04-14 14:31  we7u

	* configure.ac: Adding the no-keep-memory flag to LDFLAGS which
	  makes the link stage on Cygwin much faster.

2004-04-14 10:12  we7u

	* README.win32: Specifying a minimum set of xorg packages necessary
	  for installing the X11 stuff.  Thanks to Henk for figuring this
	  out for us!

2004-04-12 14:21  we7u

	* configure.ac: Removing one line to make output prettier.

2004-04-12 14:14  we7u

	* README.win32: Updating the package names for X11 plus removing a
	  few packages that are unnecessary.

2004-04-12 13:18  we7u

	* README.win32: Changing names of Cygwin packages to correspond to
	  Cygwin's current naming scheme for the X11 server.

2004-04-12 12:40  we7u

	* README.win32: Removed the xwinclip package from the requirements
	  per Henk de Groot.  Added notes by James Cour, K1ZC, and Tim
	  Baggett, AA5DF, regarding the network audio instructions.

2004-04-09 13:07  we7u

	* README.win32: Removing the "for future development" notes from
	  the pcre descriptions.  We use that library for dbfawk support.

2004-04-09 09:44  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Adding more notes that might make the initial user's
	  decision easier as to which libraries to compile in for the
	  desired functionality.

2004-04-08 09:14  we7u

	* config/: Makefile.am, tgr2shp.dbfawk: Adding Tom Russo's
	  tgr2shp.dbfawk file to our standard set.  Useful for the 2003
	  tiger data that just came out.

2004-04-06 21:13  we7u

	* INSTALL: Adding a note about needing "pcre" to compile in dbfawk
	  support.

2004-04-06 09:21  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding a command-line option to deselect all maps:
	  "-m"

2004-04-06 08:08  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Fix by Tom Russo:  If running with dbfawk, sets
	  everything to defaults in case a dbfawk file fails to reset
	  things when done.

2004-04-05 13:14  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a note about winclip.

2004-04-02 17:19  we7u

	* src/: geo.h, geocoder_gui.c: Extending the lengths of the input
	  fields for the Find Address function.

2004-04-02 14:16  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a note by Henk regarind lcms.

2004-04-02 13:30  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Added the Wiki page.

2004-04-02 08:03  we7u

	* configure.ac: Bumping the rev number.

2004-04-01 09:11  we7u

	* src/geo-find.c: Getting rid of some more compiler warnings.

2004-04-01 07:25  we7u

	* src/geocoder_gui.c: Fixing a compiler warning.

2004-03-31 22:11  we7u

	* src/util.c: Better implementation of the higher resolution s2l
	  routines.

2004-03-31 20:46  shadow

	* INSTALL, help/help-English.dat: document the find address feature

2004-03-31 20:26  we7u

	* src/util.c: Backing out the changes done earlier today.  Will try
	  again to implement higher resolution NMEA strings at a later
	  date.

2004-03-31 20:16  shadow

	* README.MAPS: Add pointer to Census 2003 data. Add pointer to
	  geocoder data files.

2004-03-31 10:56  we7u

	* src/util.c: Extending the NMEA sentence decoding to handle DD
	  MM.MMMM format, which the new Tinytrak-3 chips can put out.  That
	  resolution ends up being 0.6 counts of our Xastir coordinate
	  system, so we need to resolve down to that level to avoid losing
	  much.

2004-03-30 14:58  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing from circles to an 'X' for marking a found
	  address.

2004-03-30 12:49  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Saving/restoring the Mark Destination button
	  state for the Find Address function.

2004-03-30 12:44  we7u

	* src/: db.c, geo.h, geocoder_gui.c: Added a togglebutton that
	  enables/disables the marking of the destination for the Find
	  Address function.

2004-03-30 12:21  we7u

	* src/: db.c, geo.h, geocoder_gui.c: Initial attempt at marking the
	  destination target for a Find Address query.	There's not
	  capability yet for removing the marking, but you can always seek
	  another address and it will move to the new one.  Will probably
	  change to some other marking at some point (a big 'X' perhaps?),
	  and need to find a way to remove the mark that makes sense.

2004-03-30 08:58  we7u

	* src/geocoder_gui.c: Minor re-arranging of the Find Address
	  dialog's widgets.

2004-03-29 15:57  we7u

	* src/io-mmap.c: Adding an include to get rid of compiler warnings
	  about memcpy().

2004-03-29 15:40  we7u

	* src/: LICENSE.geocoder, geo-client.c, geo-find.c, geo.h,
	  geocoder_gui.c, io-common.c, io-mmap.c, io.h, Makefile.am,
	  main.c, main.h, xa_config.c: Geocoding support added by Derrick J
	  Brashear, based off code written by Daniel Egenor that was
	  released under GPL license.

2004-03-26 10:17  we7u

	* Makefile.am: Moving the .geo files into a subdirectory called
	  "Online".

2004-03-25 08:35  we7u

	* src/gps.c: Enabling setuid priviledge at the point where
	  settimeofday() is called.  Thanks to William Baguhn, kc9asi, for
	  pointing this out.

2004-03-24 17:29  shadow

	* src/macspeech.c: macspeech support, but i need to write autoconf
	  gunk, it just pretends to be festival

2004-03-23 15:12  we7u

	* INSTALL, README.win32: Updating Cygwin instructions:	com1 ->
	  /dev/ttyS0 and similar for com2.

2004-03-23 14:59  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Tweaking Cygwin serial ports to more standard port
	  names.

2004-03-23 10:01  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Changes by Bruce Bennett.

2004-03-22 14:12  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Moving an #ifdef so that no compiler warnings are
	  generated when ImageMagick support is missing.

2004-03-22 13:52  we7u

	* acinclude.m4: Fixes for Cygwin regarding comm ports.

2004-03-22 09:23  we7u

	* README.win32: Adding instructions to side-step the "detecting
	  devices" hang on WinXP.

2004-03-21 12:58  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Added info on the comment field in
	  interfaces; started a new tally of what changed since release.

2004-03-19 14:38  we7u

	* src/map_gnis.c: Removing trailing spaces while reading lines in
	  from GNIS files.  They are notorious for having many spaces at
	  the ends of the lines.

2004-03-19 12:37  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: The rest of the code needed for the
	  XReadBitmapFile() call failure, in order to make sure everything
	  keeps running.

2004-03-19 12:34  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Getting rid of the exit(1) that we were doing when
	  the XReadBitmapFile() call was failing during long runtimes.
	  It's annoying if the bitmap is not found but it shouldn't kill
	  all of Xastir in that case.  I'll be checking to see if further
	  changes to the code are necessary though to prevent segfaults
	  happening later in that part of the code.

2004-03-19 09:52  we7u

	* scripts/split_gnis.pl: Added an RCS tag.  Still needs a copyright
	  blurb.

2004-03-19 09:51  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Fixing the long transmit delay, which was in
	  port_write at the final select() call.

2004-03-18 19:21  jtwilley

	* scripts/split_gnis.pl:

	  Added split_gnis.pl to scripts directory.

	  The split_gnis.pl script will take any number of state-wide GNIS
	  files listed on the command line and create smaller files based
	  on county names.

2004-03-18 15:14  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Adding S57 map format to Xastir's supported map
	  types.  File extension currently has to be ".s57" for these types
	  of maps to be recognized by Xastir.

2004-03-18 10:11  we7u

	* scripts/ozi2geo.pl: Changed one comment.

2004-03-18 09:58  we7u

	* scripts/ozi2geo.pl: Initial attempt at a conversion script from
	  OziExplorer .map format to Xastir's .geo format.  This version
	  works with the one example map I had to work with.  More than
	  likely more work will be needed on the script as more types of
	  maps are tried.

2004-03-15 15:49  we7u

	* scripts/split_gnis.bash: Added a comment about "dos2unix".

2004-03-15 15:47  we7u

	* scripts/split_gnis.bash: Script written by William Baguhn,
	  kc9asi.  Splits a GNIS files into smaller pieces which are more
	  quickly loaded by Xastir when zoomed in.

	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/igate.c,
	  src/interface.c, src/interface.h, src/interface_gui.c,
	  src/main.c: Initial stab at creating a new SERIAL_MKISS interface
	  type.  So far it's an identical copy of the SERIAL_KISS interface
	  type, but that will change soon.  Intent is to support multi-port
	  KISS TNC's such as the Kantronics KAM.

2004-03-04 15:12  we7u

	* USRadar.geo, help/help-English.dat, src/color.c, src/color.h,

2004-03-03 14:54  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Toporama map speedups made possible by Steve

2004-03-01 23:50  we7u

	* Makefile.am, src/map_geo.c: Initial version of code to support

	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/main.c, src/main.h,
	  src/xa_config.c: Added two new trail sliders to the timing
	  dialog.  They both control whether trails are displayed, one
	  based on max distance, one based on max time.  If either max
	  distance or max time are exceeded for new trails, that segment is
	  not drawn.  Does not affect trail points that have already been
	  received, just new trail points.

2004-02-27 19:12  we7u

	* src/main.c: Modifying the Move function so that it drops through
	  all the dialogs and doesn't require any OK buttons to be pressed
	  to effect the move.  This is useful for drawing the expected
	  route of a SAR team and documenting it via Shapefiles.  It's much
	  faster to do so now.	Downside: Unintentionally moving an object
	  gets an automatic confirm, and you'll have to move it back
	  manually or else edit the object.log file by hand and read it in
	  again.

2004-02-27 18:00  we7u

2004-02-27 17:26  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.h, util.c: Turning off trail-point dupe-checking
	  when reading in objects/items from file.  This lets us show SAR
	  teams leaving and returning to base later, without having the
	  last trail segment missing.

2004-02-27 17:00  we7u

	* src/db.c: Updating some comments.

2004-02-27 15:42  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Adding notes about trails and why some
	  segments don't display.

2004-02-27 14:58  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing the distance at which Xastir will skip a track
	  segment, from >1 degree lat/long to >2 degrees.  Any track
	  segment less than 2 degrees in N/S and E/W length will get drawn,
	  as long as the time between posits is less than 45 minutes.  If
	  over 45 minutes, the segment gets skipped as well.

2004-02-26 15:25  we7u

	* src/interface.c: New code to avoid opening the same serial port
	  twice for two different interfaces.

2004-02-26 15:19  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing some debug code.

2004-02-26 13:48  we7u

	  telnet'ing to it.

2004-02-26 12:30  we7u

	* src/: map_geo.c, map_tiger.c, track_gui.c: Fixing the problem
	  where a failed internet download (map or tracklog) would cause an
	  older version of the same to get displayed.  We now delete the
	  old filename from our ~/.xastir/tmp directory before attempting
	  the download each time.

2004-02-26 12:07  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h: Adding a retry timeout for killed object/items.
	  We'll now transmit killed objects 11 times before ceasing to
	  transmit them.

	  raster_intensity changes a few weeks back.

2004-02-11 13:35  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing an annoying floating-point conversion bug in
	  the Map Intensity menus.  For 70% and 90%, they were reported as
	  60% and 80% in the menus.

2004-02-11 10:24  we7u

	* Makefile.am, USRadar.geo, src/map_geo.c, src/maps.h: Changing to
	  an unsigned long for holding the transparency value.	Adding
	  USRadar.geo as an installed map ('cuz it's just way cool).

2004-02-10 14:18  we7u

	* src/db.c: Making the 'h' in timestamp be case-insensitive on
	  receive.

2004-02-10 14:18  we7u

	* src/db.c: Making the 'h' in a timestamp be case-insensitive on
	  receive.

2004-02-09 12:20  we7u

	* src/db.c: Making N/S/E/W and the timestamp 'Z' non case-specific.
	  This was requested by Bob Bruninga on the APRSSIG mailing list
	  recently (sometime in january 2004, before our last stable
	  release).

2004-02-06 14:39  we7u

	* xastir.spec.in: Correcting the path to the man pages.

2004-01-30 10:12  we7u

	* symbols/symbols.dat: Implemented Wheelchair, Shelter, and
	  proposed Waypoint symbol.  Also changed one description from "HF
	  Gateway" to "Any Gateway (w/overlay char)".  The "Any Gateway"
	  symbol still needs to be changed into something which would
	  display an overlay char nicely.  The Shelter symbol may need to
	  be changed into something more recognizable.

2004-01-29 17:47  n2ygk

	* xastir.spec.in: --with-dbfawk.  Curt: toss this if you feel
	  dbfawk is not cooked enough.

2004-01-29 08:53  we7u

2004-01-22 19:26  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Adding sys/stat.h call that is needed to compile
	  this file on MacOSX.

2004-01-22 18:34  we7u

	* README.CVS: Updating the "unsticky" instructions for CVS.

2004-01-21 16:14  rzg

	* FAQ: Added a bit on support, fixed numbering, a typo, and
	  copyright year.

2004-01-21 15:48  we7u

	* README.CVS: Added the "diff" line to .cvsrc note.  Added "sticky"
	  tags STABLE and RELEASE and explanations of how to use them.

2004-01-21 08:47  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Changing default for "Expand Dirs" in Map
	  Chooser to 1.  Better for new users.

2004-01-20 13:34  we7u

	* FAQ: Another note about ImageMagick dependencies and "spec"

2004-01-20 13:32  we7u

	* FAQ: Adding some notes about ImageMagick and failed dependencies.

2004-01-19 15:02  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Attempting to fix an indexing bug.  New files are not
	  picked up by indexing.  This fix picks the later of ctime/mtime
	  to use for the timestamp.  Contributed by Reuven.

2004-01-19 13:33  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c: Commented out some dead code in maps.c.
	  Added new USR1 signal handler code by Tim Gimmel, KB4AMA.  Just
	  send a USR1 signal via "kill -USR1 <pid>" and Xastir will create
	  a new snapshot.  Useful for web page front-ends.

2004-01-16 12:25  gstueve

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h: Change numeric index references in flags
	  to symbolic and fixed end-of-data to match sizeof data not fixed
	  numeric values.

2004-01-16 12:18  gstueve

	  stations, written by Bruce Bennett.  Thanks Bruce!

2004-01-15 13:28  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Attempting to recover from backup file renaming
	  when things go wrong.  We'll try to get as close to the original
	  state of the files as we can.

2004-01-15 13:09  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: More config file backup copies code.  We now
	  back out the renaming if the new config file can't be created, so
	  we're left with the original config and two backups in that case.

2004-01-15 11:02  we7u

	* FAQ, src/interface.c, src/interface_gui.c, src/xa_config.c:
	  Simplified the all interfaces up/down logic.	It should work
	  better now.  Changed the config file backup code so that
	  xastir.cnf.1 through xastir.cnf.3 are created.  This should help
	  insulate us a bit better from crashes, as we'll have more old
	  copies of the config file to draw from if the main config file
	  (xastir.cnf) gets trashed.

2004-01-15 08:56  we7u

	* configure.ac: Adding a line in for getting rid of duplicates in
	  the LIBS variable.  Commented out while testing so that it
	  doesn't hurt any installations.

2004-01-14 15:07  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding more sprintf's in cases of failure to create
	  symlinks.

2004-01-14 12:07  we7u

	* configure.ac: Extending one comment.	No code changes.

2004-01-14 12:00  we7u

	* src/main.c: Minor tweak to two fprintf strings.

2004-01-12 11:44  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing back to a previous configuration for the end
	  of the create_appshell() function.  Attempting to get rid of this
	  problem:   "attempt to add non-widget child "DropSiteManager" to
	  parent "xastir"   which support only widgets" while not
	  re-creating this problem:   "Shell widget xastir has zero width
	  and/or height".

2004-01-09 10:57  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat, src/maps.c: Map index checking now allows
	  negative layer numbers.  Minor helpfile updates

2004-01-09 08:11  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More checks for invalid extents while indexing.
	  If all 0's or outside indexes of the earth, we skip adding it to
	  the index.

2004-01-08 13:38  we7u

	* src/main.c: Re-establishing the XtRealizeWidget() call in main
	  that was commented out to help fix the "zero width or height"
	  error on startup.  Now we specify a minimum size in the
	  XtVaAppInitialize() call that preceeds it, so the old problem
	  shouldn't reoccur.

2004-01-08 13:34  we7u

	* src/main.c: Gives an initial size to the application.  Makes it
	  appear to come up faster.  Whether or not it actually does is
	  beside the point.  May help to get rid of the initial sizing
	  problem: "Error: Shell widget xastir has zero width and/or
	  height".

2004-01-07 08:42  we7u

	* configure.ac: Minor tweaks to some AC_MSG_ERROR calls.

2004-01-07 08:42  we7u

	* INSTALL: Minor tweaks to the make instructions here and there.

2004-01-04 13:37  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Correcting the limits for OGR indexing.

2003-12-30 07:38  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing startup STDERR output to show which library
	  (Shapelib/OGR) is providing Shapefile support.

2003-12-26 09:26  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Bumping the read/write loop timeouts to 100ms.
	  This should provide reasonable response time when killing ports,
	  yet keep CPU usage low when no data is being read/written.

2003-12-26 08:17  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Bumping the timeout in port_write() select to
	  500ms.  That timeout is used to jump out of the select() so that
	  we can check whether the interface has gone down.  It does not
	  need to be very small, and in fact causes high CPU usage on
	  freebsd systems if it's below about 1ms.  Linux can handle
	  somewhat smaller delays (100us is ok on Linux).

2003-12-24 17:07  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Whatsnew update, and tigermap.geo is
	  back...

2003-12-23 17:49  we7u

	* src/: main.c, map_gdal.c, maps.c, xastir.h: Added another output
	  line to the segfault handler.  Minor tweaks to the OGR code.

	  object debug.  Put them inside ifdef's.

2003-12-19 16:28  we7u

	* src/: map_geo.c, map_shp.c, map_tiger.c: Fixing
	  raster_map_intensity for tiger and .geo maps.  Changes in
	  comments and remove of debugging code in map_shp.c

2003-12-19 13:33  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Minor tweak to make toposerver files work again
	  and make the .geo code look like the tiger code w.r.t. image
	  intensity.

2003-12-19 12:59  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Improvements to the line drawing routines mostly.
	  OGR stuff.

2003-12-19 12:59  we7u

	  realloc() call.

2003-12-17 22:45  we7u

	* src/map_tiger.c: ImageMagick brightness code change by Jim
	  Chandler, N0VH.

2003-12-17 22:40  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Starting to add the framework for doing X11
	  Regions.  Will allow doing "fill" and "hole" polygons as we
	  currently do in the Shapelib code.

2003-12-17 13:07  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More comments.

2003-12-17 12:58  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Minor comment changes.

2003-12-17 12:56  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More fill/hole polygon stuff.  Currently drawing
	  polygons with dashed lines for "hole" polygons, solid for "fill"
	  polygons.  This is if the use has decided not to fill the shapes.
	  For filled shapes, the hole polygons aren't drawn at all
	  currently.

2003-12-17 12:36  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More comments.  Starting to add polygon fill/hole
	  differentiation code.

	  non-filled though.

2003-12-17 07:14  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More comment changes.

2003-12-17 07:04  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Changing default colors and changing a few
	  comments.  The colors won't stay, but they're useful at the
	  moment for debugging.

2003-12-16 12:08  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added some comments.

2003-12-16 10:16  we7u

	  alert_match().

2003-12-15 09:19  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Patch by Brian Heaton to prefix the port number
	  to the incoming string we dump out via our segfault handler.

2003-12-15 07:56  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Added another SDTS note.

2003-12-13 10:36  we7u

2003-12-13 10:33  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Moved some XSet... calls down into the OGR
	  drawing section.  Above the indexing section they caused
	  segfaults.  We must not be calling the indexing functions with a
	  valid widget?

2003-12-12 17:16  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Adding more map links for some new map formats.

2003-12-12 13:20  we7u

	  points at once for each polygon.

2003-12-12 13:02  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Faster OGR line drawing.  Recognize more datums

	  aren't any clashes later with similar functions.

2003-12-12 12:17  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Speeding up OGR Point drawing.  Changing default
	  point color to white.

	  extents on those datatypes that allow fast extent checking.

2003-12-12 12:02  we7u

	* configure.ac: Minor summary text change.

2003-12-12 08:23  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Added TODO list for OGR and moved the Draw

2003-12-12 07:30  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Creating OGR Draw_Points() function which is
	  similar to the Draw_Lines() and Draw_Polygons() functions.  Skips
	  drawing points that are outside the view.

2003-12-12 06:55  we7u

	* INSTALL: Changes to the GDAL/OGR notes.

2003-12-11 17:50  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Optimizing Draw_Lines() and Draw_Polygons()
	  functions in the OGR routines.  We now check the extents of each
	  feature and skip drawing it if it's not in our view.

2003-12-11 12:35  we7u

	* src/: main.c, map_gdal.c: Fixing map_interrupts so that they work
	  properly and quickly.  A few places were broken, including the
	  new OGR code.

2003-12-11 11:42  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Changed some variable names.	Added some debug
	  code, looking for sources of memory leaks.

2003-12-10 22:43  we7u

	* INSTALL: Added a new site for Shapelib.

2003-12-10 16:31  we7u

	  types for OGR.

2003-12-10 00:01  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Minor reformatting.

2003-12-09 23:13  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Added a comment.

2003-12-09 17:03  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Better Polygons for OGR.

2003-12-09 12:27  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Drawing of OGR polygons is now working.

2003-12-09 08:55  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Slightly faster drawing code due to fewer sets of
	  debug loops.	More comments.

2003-12-09 00:22  we7u

	* src/: map_gdal.c, maps.c, maps.h: Added a new draw function for
	  points.  More tweaks to the OGR code.

2003-12-08 15:43  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Checking that I can stat a file and that it is a
	  regular file before attempting to send a file of commands to the
	  TNC.

2003-12-08 13:22  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Adding indexing for files where spatial
	  coordinate system is not known, but they still fall within the
	  normal lat/long boundaries for file extents.	We're assuming
	  they're in geographic WGS84 coordinates in this case and allowing
	  the indexing to complete.

2003-12-08 12:56  jtwilley

	* config/tnc-startup.null: Added a zero-byte file named
	  'tnc-startup.null' for those times when users do not want their
	  TNC configurations changed by xastir.

2003-12-08 12:19  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Comment updates.  No code changes this time.

2003-12-08 12:10  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Took out some debug stuff that messed with
	  converting to nad27 datum for test runs.  Generalized the code so
	  that it works with projected coordinate systems.  No computes
	  file extents for state-plane coordinate systems.  It should also
	  work for UTM projected coordinate systems.

2003-12-07 23:50  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: For file extents (indexing):	Datum translation
	  is working now for geographic coordinate systems.  Not
	  implemented yet for projected coordinate systems.  Haven't
	  implemented datum translation for drawing yet.

2003-12-07 23:47  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Forcing shapefiles back to the old code for now.

2003-12-07 23:46  we7u

	* src/maps.c: More debug for map_driver stuff.

2003-12-07 12:23  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Reducing delay in port_write for checking queue.
	  Down to 100us from 200ms.  Makes writing to interfaces much
	  snappier, but doesn't bog down CPU.  Cranking up channel_data()
	  busy wait from 1 to 2us.

2003-12-07 09:16  we7u

	* src/: main.c, xa_config.c: Fixing the 10% zoom in bug when at
	  zoom level 1.

2003-12-06 12:10  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Filling in a bit more for the OGR indexing code.

2003-12-06 09:20  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Reducing many of the usleep() delays while
	  transmitting to serial TNC's.  Users will have to rely on the new
	  delay slider to add delays if they get into weird operation with
	  any particular TNC.

2003-12-05 23:44  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More changes to debug output.

2003-12-05 23:36  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Partial map indexing working for OGR.  Must be
	  geographic coordinate system.  Haven't implemented conversions
	  from other datums or coordinate systems to geographic WGS84/NAD83
	  yet.

2003-12-05 22:33  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Printing out extents now.  Should have indexing
	  implemented soon.

2003-12-05 22:02  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More reformatting for debug purposes.

2003-12-05 19:11  we7u

2003-12-05 17:36  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Filling in more features.  Slowly.

2003-12-05 14:07  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Changing the default serial_char_pacing to 1ms
	  instead of 25ms.

2003-12-05 13:08  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Working version of what I checked in last time.
	  ;-)

2003-12-05 13:01  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More good info in the OGR code.

2003-12-05 12:40  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Fleshing out more details in the OGR driver.

2003-12-05 11:39  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Adding save/restore for serial character pacing.

2003-12-05 11:14  we7u

	  TNC's.

2003-12-04 10:58  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Changed some comments.

2003-12-04 10:08  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Adding map interrupt capability to the OGR code.

2003-12-04 08:39  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fixing up the callouts to GDAL/OGR.  We direct
	  Shapefile stuff to draw_shapefile_map() right now instead of
	  GDAL/OGR.  Tiger goes to GDAL/OGR.  This can be changed via a
	  define near the top of maps.c so that Shapefile goes to OGR as
	  well.

2003-12-04 08:36  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Getting rid of duplicate definition of font_size.

2003-12-04 08:21  n2ygk

	* src/map_shp.c: fix the font_size fix to use FONT_DEFAULT

2003-12-04 00:43  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Adding more vector types.  Currently commented out,
	  but the GDAL/OGR code will eventually support them.

2003-12-04 00:36  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added more vector formats to the Vector button in Map
	  Chooser.

2003-12-04 00:25  we7u

	  shapefiles and raw Tiger/Line polylines so far.

2003-12-03 23:23  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Fixing a compile problem for non-dbfawk compiles.

2003-12-03 17:08  n2ygk

	* src/: main.c, map_dos.c, map_pdb.c, map_shp.c, maps.c, maps.h,
	  xa_config.c, xastir.h: multiple font_sizes in maps/config/map
	  label font

2003-12-03 17:05  n2ygk

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,

2003-12-03 13:08  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Added some comments.

2003-12-03 12:53  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Removing the debug OGR code for the moment.

2003-12-03 12:52  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: OGR drawing for Shapefile polylines is starting
	  to work.  Not pretty yet.  Points/Polygons not working yet.

2003-12-03 12:51  we7u

	* src/maps.h: Adding a prototype for a function needed in
	  draw_gdal.c

2003-12-03 12:07  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: More OGR library stuff.  Am at the point where I
	  have access to the points/polylines/polygons...

2003-12-03 08:19  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.h: Changing the Map Properties dialog so that
	  it only shows maps that were selected in the Map Chooser.  Also
	  the Ok and Cancel buttons in the Map Chooser are greyed-out when
	  the Properties dialog is active (necessary due to the way I
	  implemented the new feature).

2003-12-03 00:18  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added some comments.

2003-12-02 23:42  jtwilley

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-French.sys,
	  language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Added "Select All"
	  line to the other language files.

2003-12-02 23:04  jtwilley

	* config/language-English.sys, src/main.c: Added "Select All"
	  button to "Map Properties" dialog.

2003-12-02 16:25  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Forgot an #ifdef.

2003-12-02 16:23  we7u

	* src/: map_gdal.c, map_shp.c, maps.c: Debug OGR code.	Nothing
	  truly functional yet.  Just getting a feel for how to go about
	  it.

2003-12-02 15:06  we7u

	* configure.ac: Broke libproj check out into its own section and
	  summary line.  We still need it checked in the libgeotiff section
	  as well though, as we depend on proj there too.

2003-12-02 14:16  we7u

	* src/: map_gdal.c, maps.c: Changing some warning messages.

2003-12-02 14:02  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Getting rid of compiler warnings.

2003-12-02 13:50  we7u

	* configure.ac: Moving the pcre summary next to the dbfawk summary
	  at the end of configure.  Reordered some of the rest as well,
	  putting all of the map libraries together.

2003-12-01 13:13  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Adding an include to make a compiler warning
	  disappear.

2003-12-01 12:56  we7u

	* INSTALL: Removing a note that is no longer needed.  CVS GDAL has
	  been tweaked to fix it.

2003-11-29 11:12  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Flushing out the feature set for x_spider.  Not
	  ready for prime-time yet, but getting closer.  It now echoes
	  anything received from one client out to all other connected
	  clients.  No provision yet for detecting disconnected clients and
	  removing their pipe structures.

2003-11-29 00:44  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c: Filling in more details for x_spider.  Not
	  functional yet.

2003-11-29 00:10  we7u

	* src/: x_spider.c, x_spider.h: More of the x_spider server code
	  filled in.  Not functional yet.

2003-11-28 22:34  we7u

	* src/: Makefile.am, x_spider.c, x_spider.h: Initial code for
	  x_spider server.  This is an APRS multiplexer that will
	  eventually allow multiple other clients (Xastir or otherwise) to
	  connect to a running Xastir and TX/RX APRS data between them.
	  This will allow the other clients to share the TNC, AX.25, and
	  network ports that Xastir is hooked up to.  The code is not
	  functional in that capacity yet, but it is a nice multi-connect
	  echo server as it stands.

2003-11-28 22:26  we7u

	* src/: map_gdal.c, maps.c: Adding prototype for draw_ogr_map().
	  No real code yet.

2003-11-28 22:10  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fix for the stupid "PACKAGE" warnings that the GDAL
	  include file causes.	Fix figured out originally by Jack for the
	  ImageMagick stuff, duplicated by me in the GDAL include area.

2003-11-28 21:57  we7u

	* src/main.c: Slowing down the UpdateTime() loop iteration.  Some
	  systems (RedHat/FreeBSD) appear to use up a lot of CPU time if
	  this is set to '1' or '0'.  Setting it to '2'.  Will crank it up
	  some more if people still report high CPU usage.

2003-11-28 14:55  kd6zwr

	* src/: main.c, map_gdal.c, maps.c: Cleaning up GDAL init, starting
	  gdal code.

2003-11-26 18:47  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing from strstr() to strncmp() for matching
	  selected directories with files inside them.	Much more exact.

2003-11-26 14:10  we7u

	* src/main.c: Clearing the selected bits in the in-memory map index
	  before we try to resync with the selected_maps.sys file's idea of
	  what maps are selected.

2003-11-26 12:04  we7u

	* INSTALL: Adding GDAL instructions (not that there's much that can
	  be done with it yet, but it's still nice to see the future list
	  of supported map formats on startup!).

2003-11-26 09:37  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Getting rid of compiler warning when XPM is not
	  available.  This fix makes sure that the snapshot thread doesn't
	  even get defined in that case.

2003-11-26 09:00  we7u

	* src/testawk.c: Fixing another couple of compiler warnings.

2003-11-26 08:54  we7u

	* src/awk.c: Fixing more compiler warnings.  Trivial stuff.

2003-11-26 08:43  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Getting rid of another compiler warning.

2003-11-26 08:35  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c: Getting rid of compiler warnings.

2003-11-26 08:29  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Getting rid of compiler warnings and removing dead
	  code.

2003-11-26 08:25  we7u

	* src/map_tiger.c: Fixing a compiler warning, although I can't for
	  the life of me figure out why the compiler is confused.  Perhaps
	  all of the #ifdef's confused it.

2003-11-26 08:14  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Fixing a compiler warning.

2003-11-26 08:01  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changing one variable to unsigned to get rid of
	  a compiler warning.  We don't need a signed variable there
	  anyway.

2003-11-25 18:19  we7u

	* src/main.c: Converting to square meters/feet when the CAD
	  object's area is too small for miles/km.

2003-11-25 14:34  n2ygk

	* config/tgrlk.dbfawk: label color blue for water

2003-11-25 14:14  we7u

	* src/main.c: Making the End Draw Mode function write the CAD
	  objects out to disk as well.	This makes it possible to save open
	  polygons (polylines) instead of only closed polygons.

2003-11-25 12:49  we7u

	* src/main.c: Persistent CAD Objects.  They get save/restored
	  to/from file now.

2003-11-25 10:32  we7u

	* src/db.h: Changing the saved polygon area from an int to a float.

2003-11-25 10:31  we7u

	* src/main.c: Leaving the calculations in square nautical miles
	  until we're finished, then converting to what the user needs.
	  Saving the area now in the object in units of square kilometers.

2003-11-25 10:01  we7u

	* src/main.c: Issuing a popup message with the area measurement.

2003-11-25 09:49  we7u

	* src/main.c: More corrections to the area calculation.

2003-11-25 09:33  we7u

	* src/main.c: Forgot to add in the minus signs again.  Area should
	  be closer to being correct now for polygons.

2003-11-25 09:25  we7u

	* src/main.c: Computing area of a polygon.  Correctly now I think.

2003-11-25 07:29  we7u

	* src/main.c: More CAD Drawing stuff.  We now only compute area on
	  polygons with 3 or more points, and don't "close" a polygon
	  unless it has 3 or more points.

2003-11-25 07:14  we7u

	* src/main.c: More CAD Drawing stuff.

2003-11-25 07:05  n2ygk

	* src/map_shp.c: update comments

2003-11-25 00:46  we7u

	* src/main.c: Beginnings of computing area for a drawn polygon.

2003-11-24 23:42  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, main.c, main.h, util.c, util.h: First
	  semi-functional implementation of CAD drawing functions.  No
	  persistent storage has been implemented yet.

2003-11-24 16:45  we7u

	* src/maps.h: Exporting another function I'll need later in another
	  module.

2003-11-24 14:38  we7u

	* src/main.c: Renaming one function.

	  src/list_gui.c, src/main.c, src/main.h, src/maps.c,
	  src/xa_config.c: Adding the capability to use the special UTM
	  zones with a new UTM selection, instead of using them only for
	  MGRS.  Seems some areas use them for regular UTM as well.

2003-11-24 13:32  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added more comments and some function prototypes for
	  CAD objects.

2003-11-24 12:49  we7u

	  along now even when xfontsel is up and running.

2003-11-24 11:20  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Updates for recent changes.

2003-11-24 10:35  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added some comments to the xfontsel code.

2003-11-24 10:24  n2ygk

	* src/main.c: simplified implementation of xfontsel using popen.

2003-11-23 23:07  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added another comment regarding xfontsel and possible
	  conversion to another thread.

2003-11-23 22:50  we7u

	* src/main.c: We now write the output of xfontsel back into the Map
	  Label Font dialog via the use of an intermediate file we write to
	  ~/.xastir/tmp.

2003-11-23 21:50  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,

	  map label font dialog.

2003-11-22 20:38  we7u

	* src/main.c: More temporary CAD drawing changes.  These allow
	  experimentation without the drawings disappearing.  Drawings do
	  not survive pan or zoom though.

2003-11-22 15:40  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added crosshair cursor for Measure/Move modes, and
	  pencil cursor for CAD Draw mode.

2003-11-21 13:55  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing a pointer problem that Jack Twilley found.  This
	  one occurs when we're deleting expired stations from our database
	  in time order.  We weren't saving a pointer to the next
	  time-ordered record before free'ing the memory for the first.

2003-11-16 22:14  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding some comments.  No code changes.

2003-11-16 15:33  we7u

	  shpproj.

2003-11-13 10:37  we7u

	  Non-functional so far.

2003-11-13 10:11  we7u

	* src/main.c: Moving more menu stuff around.  Making it harder to
	  move my station using the mouse.  Put Pan stuff in a submenu to
	  make the main mouse menu shorter.

2003-11-13 09:52  we7u

	* src/main.c: More Draw CAD-mode stuff.

2003-11-13 09:29  we7u

	  prime-time yet.

2003-11-13 08:16  we7u

	* src/main.c: Moving the "Move my station here" menu option to the
	  very bottom, more out of the way.

	  color.

2003-11-12 13:23  we7u

	* INSTALL: Changing some instructions to use "su -c" instead of
	  "su" and "exit".

2003-11-11 21:37  we7u

	* src/main.c: Very preliminary etch-a-sketch mode.  Allows the
	  operator to draw lines on top of the map display.  Eventually
	  this will be turned into something useful.  Right now the lines
	  disappear at the next screen refresh.

2003-11-11 07:03  n2ygk

	* config/: nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsmzddmmyy.dbfawk,

	  tgrlpy.dbfawk, tgrplc00.dbfawk, tgrwat.dbfawk: "pattern" set to
	  match X line attribute.  Also some other minor tweaking.

2003-11-11 07:02  n2ygk

	* src/map_shp.c: add default dbfawk when signature not found.
	  change "pattern" to just be the X line attribute pattern (0, 1,
	  or 2).

2003-11-10 09:18  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing the default symbol to a dot.  Used to be the
	  emergency symbol, which is probably not a good idea as a default.

2003-11-10 08:39  we7u

	* src/main.c: Saving/restoring comment and name fields when
	  switching between different types of Create Object/Item dialogs.

	  now.

2003-11-07 13:46  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fixing a problem whereby the weather alert filenames
	  are guessed wrong if there are similarly-names zip files in the
	  Counties directory.

2003-11-07 10:15  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing objects/items with respect to probability
	  circles and multipoint polygons.  We can now do compressed
	  objects/items with these features, and we get a space before the
	  multipoint string, as the spec requires.

2003-11-06 15:27  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing the extract_multipoints() function so that it
	  doesn't remove the multipoint string from the comment field of
	  objects or items.  This allows us to transmit the multipoint
	  string every time we transmit the object/item.

2003-11-06 15:26  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Changed one comment.

2003-11-06 09:21  we7u

2003-11-04 15:00  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added a rather stupid fix for the problem: 'Error:
	  attempt to add non-widget child "DropSiteManager" to parent
	  "xastir"'.  Making a couple of harmless Motif calls before
	  calling XtVaCreateWidget in create_appshell().

2003-11-04 14:24  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Wrapping a call with ifdef's for people that don't
	  have ImageMagick compiled in.

2003-11-04 14:20  we7u

	* tigermap.geo: Adding this file so that Tigermap may be a normal
	  option in the Map Chooser.

2003-11-04 13:46  we7u

	* src/main.c: Moving things around to different menus.	Cleaning up
	  the interface just a bit.

2003-11-04 11:28  we7u

2003-11-03 13:22  we7u

	* src/location_gui.c: Removing unnecessary db.h include.

2003-11-03 13:22  we7u

	  format.  Still has problems in the south polar region, but other
	  than that it appears to work properly.

2003-11-03 08:10  we7u

	* src/util.c: Switching to MGRS zones when doing MGRS conversions,

	  Changed some math to make it more understandable what was going
	  on.

2003-11-03 08:08  we7u

	* src/datum.c: Changed a comment.

2003-11-01 10:57  we7u

2003-10-31 21:15  we7u

	* src/util.c: Changing the formatting for MGRS.

2003-10-31 16:35  we7u

	* src/util.c: MGRS appears to be functional in the UTM area.  Still

2003-10-31 15:35  we7u

	* src/: datum.c, datum.h, db.c, list_gui.c, main.c, main.h, maps.c,

	  language files.

2003-10-30 10:50  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: More error-checking for lat/long as read in from

2003-10-29 19:38  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fixing the edges of the earth, UTM grid style.

2003-10-29 13:03  we7u

	* src/: datum.c, datum.h, maps.c: Fixing the UTM grid.	Added
	  "MGRS_grid" variable.  If set, we draw the irregular grids and
	  report UTM coordinates using those grids.  If zero, we draw the
	  regularly-spaced six-degree zones and report using those regular
	  zones.

2003-10-29 12:50  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Correcting UTM grid for the civilian UTM grid
	  (non-MGRS grid).

2003-10-29 12:27  we7u

	* src/main.c: Saving our place in the Map Properties dialog.  No
	  more scrolling trying to get back to where you were.

2003-10-29 11:59  we7u

	* src/main.c: Commenting out debug code.

2003-10-29 11:51  we7u

	* src/main.c: Commenting out a debug line.

2003-10-29 11:23  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Adding code to migrate from old map_index.sys format
	  to the new format.  Accepts either 8 or 10 parameters per line
	  and writes out the new 10-parameter format if the 8-parameter
	  format is found.  Swapped the max_zoom and min_zoom parameters to
	  further down the data line.

2003-10-28 22:26  jtwilley

	* config/language-English.sys, src/main.c, src/maps.c, src/maps.h:
	  Added support for max/min zoom levels.  Work still needs to be
	  done on removing existing zoom-level-sensitive code and
	  supporting other languages.

2003-10-28 16:35  we7u

	* src/main.c: Moved the "XtRealize" call down lower in the routine,
	  after the size has been specified.  This is to help get rid of
	  the "Error: Shell widget xastir has zero width and/or height"
	  problem that some users have been having.

2003-10-28 16:29  we7u

	* src/main.c: Moving the "manage" call for the main app down lower
	  after the size of the widget has been specified.  Attempting to
	  get rid of the "Error: Shell widget xastir has zero width and/or
	  height" problem that some users are still having.

2003-10-28 15:46  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Setting screen_height and screen_width to
	  minimums of 40 and 100.

2003-10-28 15:20  we7u

	* src/main.c: Getting rid of the auto-clear function for the map

2003-10-28 07:02  n2ygk

	* src/list_gui.c: Fix X crash when list width/height somehow get
	  set to zero.

2003-10-27 17:40  rzg

	* src/maps.c: Commenting out some debug lines.

2003-10-22 16:06  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fixing another bug in draw_grid() that caused a
	  segfault while drawing UTM grids.  Added more debug and comments.
	  The segfault fix causes some grid lines to get skipped but
	  that's better than a segfault.

2003-10-22 14:39  we7u

	* src/maps.c: More comment changes.

2003-10-22 14:08  we7u

2003-10-22 12:50  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Adding lots of comments in the draw_grid() function.
	  Trying to understand Olivier's code for drawing UTM grids, so it
	  can be improved in the areas of major grid intersections, and in
	  handling the irregular zone widths.

2003-10-22 11:43  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changed some comments.

2003-10-22 09:33  we7u

2003-10-22 09:32  we7u

	* src/maps.c: [no log message]

2003-10-22 06:57  n2ygk

	* README.MAPS, config/tgrlpt.dbfawk, src/map_shp.c: dbfawk symbol
	  support for point shapefiles

2003-10-21 08:22  n2ygk

	* src/map_shp.c: duh - sym[4] to fit the null at the end!

2003-10-21 08:21  n2ygk

	* src/map_shp.c: sym[3] to allow for overlay char too

2003-10-21 08:20  n2ygk

2003-10-19 15:26  we7u

	* src/datum.c: Fixing the output zone number in the UPS regions to
	  "00".

2003-10-17 23:13  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Tweaking the UTM grid so that it extends to the
	  poles, now that I know what the UPS grid (near the poles) should
	  look like.

2003-10-17 22:55  we7u

	* src/: datum.c, datum.h, main.c, map_geo.c, maps.c, util.c:
	  Implemented proper UTM/UPS to Lat/Long conversions.  Also fixed
	  the coordinate calculator so it would accept UPS coordinates.

2003-10-17 21:49  we7u

	* src/: datum.c, datum.h, main.c, map_geo.c, maps.c, util.c:
	  Implemented proper UPS output, when using UTM/UPS and near the
	  poles.

2003-10-17 20:22  we7u

	* src/datum.c: Temporarily making the easting and northing for the
	  UPS areas (near the poles) equal to all zeroes.  This is to
	  prevent someone thinking that the numbers we're showing are valid
	  coordinates.	We haven't been computing proper coordinates in the
	  UPS areas.  Am still working on the problem and hope to have
	  valid UPS numbers by the end of the weekend.

2003-10-17 14:21  we7u

	* src/datum.c: Changed some comments.  Added some output if we're
	  trying to convert a UPS coordinate to Lat/Long.

2003-10-17 13:39  we7u

	* src/: datum.c, datum.h: Changed utm_letter_designator() to
	  properly handle the zones for UPS grid.  Still need to get the
	  easting/northing numbers to work right, but the zone letters are
	  now correct.

2003-10-17 12:50  we7u

	* src/datum.c: Modified utm_letter_designator() function so that
	  'Z' is displayed above 84N, and 'A' is displayed below 80S.  It's
	  better than it was, but we still need to implement full UPS
	  coordinate systems in the pole regions.

2003-10-17 12:38  we7u

	* src/main.c: Tweaking TrackMouse() so that the coordinates stop
	  changing when the mouse goes off the edge of the earth.

2003-10-17 08:21  n2ygk

	* src/map_shp.c: still incomplete attempt at handling fill styles.

2003-10-17 08:19  n2ygk

	* config/: Makefile.am, tgrlpt.dbfawk: add tgrlpt (Tiger/Line
	  landmark points)

2003-10-17 08:18  n2ygk

	* config/tgrlk.dbfawk: add complete documentation of CFCC codes

2003-10-17 02:13  we7u

	* bootstrap.sh: Added a line to remove the autom4te.cache directory
	  and contents.  This sometimes gets in the way when running
	  autoheader, and I have to delete it manually in that case.  No
	  more.

2003-10-16 16:38  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Excluding map indexing from being able to set the

	* src/map_gdal.c: Changed comments.  No code changes.

2003-10-16 14:44  we7u

	* configure.ac: Moving the GDAL stuff after shapelib and
	  libgeotiff.  We want GDAL to get linked AFTER the other
	  libraries, at least until we get GDAL fully integrated.  If GDAL
	  is linked earlier than these other libraries, function calls get
	  made to GDAL instead of the correct libraries.

2003-10-16 14:42  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c: Added more debugging output.

2003-10-16 14:39  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Minor stuff, getting ready to try to open a file.

2003-10-16 12:40  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Printing out OGR drivers as well now.

2003-10-16 12:33  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Nicer formatting for the GDAL drivers.

2003-10-16 12:30  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Better formatting for listing GDAL drivers.
	  Starting to add code to list OGR drivers as well.

2003-10-16 11:58  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Print out a list of all registered GDAL drivers
	  upon Xastir startup.

2003-10-16 09:56  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Moved the #warning text inside the #ifdef block.
	  Will only see the warning if GDAL is installed and usable on your
	  system.

2003-10-16 09:48  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Minor changes to comments.  Removed a #define
	  that shouldn't have been committed.

2003-10-16 09:42  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Added example code snippets from the GDAL
	  tutorial.

2003-10-16 09:07  we7u

	* configure.ac, src/main.c, src/map_gdal.c, src/maps.h: More
	  initial framework for GDAL integration.  Now adds it to the list
	  of supported libraries in "configure", and adds the library to
	  the link line.

2003-10-16 08:30  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: Adding map_gdal.c to the list of files.

2003-10-16 08:29  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c: Adding initial file framework for integrating the
	  GDAL library.  No real code here yet.

2003-10-14 13:49  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Another #ifdef fix regarding raster_map_intensity.

2003-10-14 13:44  we7u

	* src/main.c: More #ifdef cleanup regarding raster_map_intensity.

2003-10-14 13:37  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.h, xa_config.c: Fixing #ifdef's, consistent
	  with new uses of raster_map_intensity variable (used to be
	  geotiff_map_intensity).

2003-10-13 14:46  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/draw_symbols.c,
	  src/draw_symbols.h, src/main.c, src/main.h, src/xa_config.c:
	  Implementing Henk de Groot's icon outline code.  Added code to
	  make the changes instantly visible in the drawing area.  Thanks
	  Henk!

2003-10-13 14:30  we7u

	* src/: main.c, map_geo.c, map_tif.c, maps.c, maps.h, xa_config.c:
	  Attached geo files to the raster intensity variable, so they can
	  be darkened from the menus now.  Had to hard-code toposerver
	  images to be 100% brightness though, as the colors get strange on
	  that particular image.  Other images can be fixed by adding the
	  "modulate" tag to the .geo file, if this problem should surface
	  elsewhere.

2003-10-13 13:22  we7u

	* src/maps.c: More efficient snapshot code:  Moved the .geo code
	  back into the separate thread now that the symbol-blanking bug is
	  fixed.

2003-10-13 12:57  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fixed snapshots so that .geo file creation works
	  without blanking symbols on the screen.  The code was leaving
	  incorrect values in global variables that were later used by the
	  symbol drawing code.

2003-10-13 10:57  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, xastir.h: Fixing the
	  symbols-going-away-after-snapshot problem.  Unfortunately it
	  appears that the .geo code for snapshots is the problem.  Will
	  have to figure out why yet and then reinstate that part of the
	  code.

2003-10-12 21:22  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, xastir.h: Attempting to fix the snapshot
	  problem where stations disappear off the display.  Created
	  another Pixmap:  pixmap_snapshot, and copy pixmap_final to it
	  just before the snapshot thread is started.  This should separate
	  any accesses to the data so that no conflicts occur while making
	  the snapshot.

2003-10-09 19:20  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Tweaking the width of the equator line in UTM grid
	  (again).

2003-10-09 19:14  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Minor changes to equator/prime meridian again for
	  UTM.

2003-10-09 18:41  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing line widths for the lat/long grid and the
	  major UTM zones to width 2.  This makes them more noticeable
	  against the smaller UTM subgrid and against map lines.

2003-10-09 13:16  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing the color for lat/long grids as well so that
	  they work with the gc_tint stuff and show up on maps well.

2003-10-09 13:09  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing to gc_tint for map grids so that the grid
	  can always be seen on top of maps.

2003-10-09 12:52  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Switching to purple lines as they show up well on
	  topo and terraserver maps.

2003-10-09 12:47  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing the smaller UTM grids to display in bright
	  yellow.  Easier to see on maps.

2003-10-09 09:18  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Initial attempt at finer UTM grids, using preliminary
	  code by Olivier Calle (N7TAP).  The code handles the irregular
	  regions near/above Norway for the major UTM grid zones only (not
	  for the minor grids yet).  There are known problems near the zone
	  boundaries with lines not getting drawn or incorrect lines
	  getting drawn.  For the most part, if you're inside a zone and
	  not in the irregular zone area, this code works very well, and is
	  very fast!

2003-10-09 09:03  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c, map_geo.c: Changing a few printf's to
	  fprintf's.

2003-10-08 12:48  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Simplified code for drawing UTM grid.

2003-10-08 12:12  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing the UTM grid to dashed lines instead of
	  solid.

2003-10-08 11:31  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Proper UTM grid, including irregular areas near
	  Norway.  Area from 84N to 90N and 80S to 90S is still in
	  question, as that is in the UPS coordinate system area (the
	  poles).  Also, the UTM coordinates on the status line are
	  incorrect when the mouse pointer is moved into these areas.

2003-10-08 10:16  we7u

	* src/maps.c: More draw_vector stuff.  Both Xastir coordinate
	  system and lat/long vector drawing functions work now.  Still
	  need to work on the "is it in the view" code, as it's not working
	  correctly..

2003-10-08 09:42  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added more UTM grid comments.

2003-10-08 09:37  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Adding a new draw_vector() function, which I'll use
	  for drawing the UTM grid shortly.  Changed/added a bunch of
	  comments in draw_grid() regarding UTM.

2003-10-07 12:59  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changed some comments.

2003-10-07 11:51  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Tweaked the boundary checks before the XDrawLine
	  call.  Added/changed some comments regarding UTM grid.

2003-10-06 19:41  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Initial UTM grid attempt.  This mod causes the six
	  degree vertical lines to be drawn that define the major UTM
	  zones.  It will draw them if the map grid is enabled and UTM is
	  the selected coordinate system.

2003-10-02 16:51  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing the Pmin/Pmax stuff so that it gets transmitted
	  properly across the air.

2003-10-02 13:21  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Xastir now creates a snapshot.geo file corresponding
	  to the snapshot.png file.

2003-10-02 10:08  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a note about removing the "-local" option for
	  nasd.

2003-10-02 07:09  n2ygk

	* src/main.c: Duh.  Hung Map_font off of Gamma_correct button.

2003-09-30 06:57  n2ygk

	* INSTALL, README.MAPS: document dbfawk

2003-09-28 15:39  n2ygk

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-French.sys,
	  language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Add map label font
	  selection (please translate these!)

2003-09-28 00:03  we7u

	* src/xastir.h: Minor tweak to fix a compile problem in main.c with
	  sizeof().

2003-09-27 07:18  n2ygk

	* config/language-English.sys, src/awk.c, src/awk.h, src/dbfawk.c,
	  src/main.c, src/map_shp.c, src/maps.c, src/xa_config.c,
	  src/xastir.h: Add user-selectable MAPS_LABEL_FONT.  Add
	  dbfawk-selectable label color.  Add "skip" keyword to dbfawk to
	  permit overriding bad shapefile dbf data.

2003-09-26 16:34  we7u

	* README.win32: Clarified that maps can go in the maps directory
	  and subdirectories thereof.

2003-09-26 16:26  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a note about possible problems with IM-5.5.7.

2003-09-26 16:22  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Specified where the sound files go.

2003-09-26 10:06  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c: Added an "Apply" button
	  to the Map Chooser that applies the changes immediately without
	  destroying the Map Chooser.

2003-09-26 09:16  we7u

	* README.win32: Added note about Perl 5.8 and page faults while
	  compiling.

2003-09-19 16:48  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a note about ImageMagick being necessary to
	  view .geo maps.

2003-09-19 16:41  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a Win2k note.

2003-09-19 16:34  we7u

2003-09-19 15:40  we7u

	* README.win32: Better fix for the _reent bug.

2003-09-19 15:37  we7u

	* README.win32: Added another note about the _reent bug.

2003-09-19 10:58  we7u

	* README.MAPS: Minor changes to the download NOAA weather alert
	  maps section.

2003-09-19 10:57  we7u

	* src/util.c: Caused the code to recognize "NWS_" as valid.  Didn't
	  appear to be doing so, which might have been knocking out a lot
	  of compressed weather alerts.

2003-09-19 10:57  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changed some comments.

2003-09-19 10:56  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Minor changes to comments and added another possible
	  case for SOLAR that can get parsed (don't know if it'll ever get
	  used).

2003-09-18 12:38  we7u

	* src/main.c: Setting the initial symbol to be a hiker when
	  creating new object/item with probability circle toggle enabled.

2003-09-18 12:04  we7u

	* src/: main.c, db.c: Working implementation of SAR probability
	  circles.

2003-09-17 17:24  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, draw_symbols.c, draw_symbols.h, main.c: Half of
	  an implementation for drawing Search & Rescue probability
	  circles.  Have the encoding parts and display parts done.  Next
	  need to do the decoding so that the circles show up on the map.

2003-09-16 10:46  we7u

	* src/xastir.h: Adding preliminary support for the libgc garbage
	  collection library.  Disabled by default.  This gives automatic
	  garbage collection of unused memory space to Xastir.	During long
	  runtimes, this seems to improve memory usage a bit.

2003-09-16 10:13  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c: Fixing trans_skip for the non-ImageMagick case.

2003-09-15 11:49  we7u

	* README.win32: Very minor wording change in the CVS instructions.

2003-09-12 07:48  n2ygk

	* configure.ac, src/dbfawk.c, src/map_shp.c: properly
	  conditionalize WITH_DBFAWK.  More dbfawk tweaks in map_shp

2003-09-11 15:04  jtwilley

	* src/dbfawk.c: Added check for DBFAWK define.

2003-09-11 13:19  n2ygk

	* config/nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk, src/map_shp.c: Fix a stupid error in
	  symtbl

	* help/help-English.dat: whatsnew update

2003-09-10 13:27  kd6zwr

	* README.MAPS, help/help-English.dat, src/map_geo.c, src/maps.h:
	  Changing TRANSPARENT geo tag to accept a user defined color to
	  zap.

2003-09-09 06:56  n2ygk

	* config/nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk, config/tgrcty.dbfawk,
	  config/tgrkgl.dbfawk, config/tgrwat.dbfawk, src/map_shp.c: more
	  dbfawk tweaking

2003-09-08 07:37  n2ygk

	* config/nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk, config/nwsozddmmyy.dbfawk,
	  config/nwsw_ddmmyy.dbfawk, config/nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk,
	  src/map_shp.c: more dbfawk tweaks.  WX alerts now search
	  properly.

2003-09-05 14:25  we7u

	* src/main.c: Removed some unneeded comments.

2003-09-05 14:12  we7u

	* src/main.c: Taking out the Move/Measure menu prevention logic for
	  the case where the mouse buttons are _not_ swapped.

2003-09-05 13:20  we7u

	* src/main.c: Preventing the mouse menu from coming up if SWAP
	  buttons is enabled and we're doing the Move or Measure functions.

2003-09-05 12:47  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added another define that allows moving the mouse
	  menu to button1.

2003-09-05 12:07  we7u

	* src/main.c: Swapping zoom/pan buttons so that zoom buttons are
	  more often on the screen with a small window size.

2003-09-05 06:56  n2ygk

	* config/: Makefile.am, nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsmzddmmyy.dbfawk,
	  nwsozddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsw_ddmmyy.dbfawk, nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk: First
	  pass at handling WX alerts with dbfawk

2003-09-04 23:37  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added some notes about xmodmap for swapping mouse
	  buttons in a touchscreen configuraton.

2003-09-04 15:48  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys: Making Z-In/Z-Out labels shorter to
	  help fit on 640x480 LCD screen.

2003-09-04 15:28  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing the optional SMALL system font.

2003-09-04 14:39  n2ygk

	* src/testawk.c: Make it compile even without DBFAWK

2003-09-04 14:22  we7u

	* INSTALL: Added a bit more about libgeotiff's private include
	  directory.

2003-09-04 11:00  we7u

	* src/main.c: Another tweak for fixed-size small displays.  This
	  new define forces dialogs to pop up over the main application,
	  near the left top corner.

2003-09-04 10:11  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding an option for a much smaller default system
	  font.  Useful for smaller displays.

2003-09-04 10:10  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys: Making Zoom buttons smaller by
	  shortening the string.  Needed for smaller displays.

2003-09-04 09:40  we7u

	* src/: main.c, xa_config.c: Allowing much smaller screen sizes for
	  Xastir.  It should start up in roughly the same size as saved now
	  also.

2003-09-04 09:18  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing the minimum size for the main window down to
	  1/4 VGA.  This allows it to be resized much smaller than before.
	  Useful for fixed-size LCD displays.

2003-09-04 09:11  we7u

	* FAQ: Added a few more words about why stations might not appear

2003-09-03 17:01  we7u

	* INSTALL: Revised the libgeotiff instructions slightly.

2003-09-03 12:37  we7u

	* README.win32: Added "touch .cvspass" to the instructions.  Some
	  Windows boxes fail without this.

2003-09-03 11:26  kd6zwr

	* README.MAPS, help/help-English.dat: Documenting the new
	  TRANSPARENT and CROP .geo file tags.

2003-09-03 08:19  n2ygk

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/awk.c, src/dbfawk.c,
	  src/dbfawk.h, src/map_shp.c, src/testawk.c: change to use
	  WITH_DBFAWK.	dbfawk now searches for mapfilename.dbfawk before
	  looking in config/*.dbfawk, enabling map-specific special cases.

2003-09-03 00:28  kd6zwr

	* src/: map_geo.c, maps.h: Adding TRANSPARENT and CROP tags to the
	  geo file.  First cut at transparent, needs to be augmented to
	  allow a list of colors to zap.

2003-09-02 16:43  jtwilley

	* configure.ac: Moved AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE and added arguments.

	  Added documentation for AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.

2003-09-02 14:05  n2ygk

	* config/tgrcty.dbfawk, src/map_shp.c: tgrcty: fix Louisiana FIPS
	  code map_shp: start adding layer setting via dbfawk too

2003-09-02 10:50  we7u

	* README.win32: Added another comment about "nano" being more
	  user-friendly than "vi", for people coming from a Windows
	  background.

2003-08-30 13:41  jtwilley

	* src/awk.c: Added reference to <sys/types.h> to match dbfawk.c

2003-08-29 09:50  n2ygk

	* configure.ac, config/Makefile.am, config/tgrcty.dbfawk,
	  config/tgrkgl.dbfawk, config/tgrlk.dbfawk, config/tgrwat.dbfawk,
	  src/Makefile.am, src/awk.c, src/awk.h, src/dbfawk.c,
	  src/dbfawk.h, src/gps.c, src/map_shp.c, src/testawk.c,
	  src/tgrcty.dbfawk, src/tgrkgl.dbfawk, src/tgrlk.dbfawk: gps.c:
	  handle spurious compile time warning everything else: add dbfawk
	  support for shapefile maps.  Enable with:	./configure
	  --with-dbfawk

2003-08-22 21:37  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Adding another #include, needed for usleep()
	  call.

2003-08-21 15:01  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changed some comment formatting.

2003-08-21 14:10  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Adding a delay after shutting down a port
	  before it is brought up again.  These delays are in the
	  interfaces->properties menu when changing an interface that's
	  running.

2003-08-21 12:31  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h: Added a new flag to WeatherRow called wx_storm.
	  We wet it when we find any kind of a severe storm, then use that
	  flag in our logic that decides how to draw things.  This gets rid
	  of wind barbs for some severe storms.

2003-08-21 11:01  we7u

	* scripts/inf2geo.pl: New revisions by ZL2UMF.	Thanks!

2003-08-21 09:42  we7u

	* src/igate.c: We now drop generic queries heading to RF.  Also
	  tweaked the log reject messages to be more consistent.

2003-08-21 09:30  we7u

	* src/igate.c: Removed the '*' requirement for TCPXX*, so we now
	  reject anything with TCPXX in it.  Added NOGATE options for
	  dropping packets to all igate functions.  Added generic query
	  rejection for gating to 'net.  Still need to add it into the
	  gate-to-rf code.

2003-08-20 12:55  we7u

	* symbols/symbols.dat: Changing the "smoke" symbol so that it shows
	  a volcano instead of a smokestack.  This is more inline with the
	  reason the weather server puts out these symbols, and is more
	  recognizable than the smokestack symbol anyway.

2003-08-20 11:05  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing the network port check from 7.5 minutes down
	  to one minute.  This should reconnect ports more quickly if/when
	  they go down.

2003-08-18 16:16  we7u

	* src/db.c: Removing a back-slash that got in there accidentally.

2003-08-18 15:46  we7u

	* src/db.c: Getting the sort order correct for inserting records
	  into the station database.  Didn't work well with the wrong
	  order.

2003-08-18 11:09  we7u

	* src/db.c: Commenting out some speedup code in
	  station_shortcuts_update_function() that may be causing problems
	  at present.

2003-08-18 10:40  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Henk's fix to a pointer problem that I created
	  recently.

2003-08-16 23:04  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing a bug in the hash table code which looks for
	  station matches.  Making the clear all stations function faster
	  by clearing out the hash table first.

2003-08-15 18:40  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Making index_retrieve() faster by relying on
	  alphanumerical ordering of the map files in the index list.  We
	  now save the pointer between runs, and start searching the list
	  at the point we left off.

2003-08-15 18:12  we7u

	* src/main.c: Minor comment cleanup and removing dead code.

2003-08-15 18:04  we7u

	* src/main.c: Better pointers for Map Chooser select updates.

2003-08-15 17:53  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing from n*n searches to n searches for updating
	  selected bits when closing Map Chooser.

2003-08-15 17:12  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Bumping out of port_read less often.  This is
	  only to check whether the thread should be taken down anyway.  If
	  a packet is waiting for us to read it, we'll wake up out of the
	  select() anyway.

2003-08-15 16:55  we7u

	* src/main.c: Rearranging some if statements to get a little more
	  speed out of it.

2003-08-15 16:11  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, maps.h: Added caching of XmString values
	  corresponding to the map filenames for the Map Chooser.  The
	  first time bringing up Map Chooser will be at the same speed as
	  before.  Second and succeeding invocations of the Map Chooser
	  should be a bit faster because the XmString's are used from the
	  map index records again instead of being created from scratch
	  each time.

2003-08-15 12:30  we7u

	* src/interface.c: CPU-usage optimization tweak to port_read().

2003-08-15 12:11  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, main.c: CPU-usage tweak for dtr_all_set calls.
	  It was getting called constantly whenever an HSP port was
	  enabled.

2003-08-15 11:51  we7u

	* src/maps.c: CPU-usage tweak to index_retrieve().

2003-08-15 11:20  we7u

	* src/db.c: Yet another CPU-usage tweak.  This one is to
	  search_station_name().  It's more efficient now at finding
	  stations in the linked list, using a hash table as a jumping-off
	  point.

2003-08-14 15:02  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Changing the level at which shorelines get drawn.

2003-08-14 14:59  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Setting up more levels at which things won't be
	  drawn.  Will make things faster/less cluttered.

2003-08-14 14:46  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Optimizing shapefile vector drawing.  We don't
	  convert the coordinates for each point now unless we're going to
	  draw the darn thing.

2003-08-14 13:52  we7u

	* src/maps.c: More speedups.

2003-08-14 13:27  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Added some comments.

2003-08-14 09:12  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, maps.h, xastir.h: First part of speeding up
	  Shapefile drawing by staying with lat/long values as much as
	  possible, rather than doing conversions to Xastir coordinate
	  system at every step.  The end goal is to do as little math as
	  possible to put pixels on the screen.  These changes give a
	  slight speedup to shapefile drawing, noticeable only when loading
	  lots of maps.

2003-08-13 16:26  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Reverting back to last version.  Floats made
	  CPU-usage worse in this case.

2003-08-13 15:49  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Speedups.  Using floating point operations instead
	  of unsigned longs.

2003-08-13 12:45  gstueve

	* .cvsignore, callpass/.cvsignore, config/.cvsignore,
	  help/.cvsignore, m4/.cvsignore, scripts/.cvsignore,
	  src/.cvsignore, symbols/.cvsignore: Ignore generated files within
	  CVS base.

2003-08-13 12:38  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Made the symbol() routine more efficient.
	  Uses much less CPU now.

2003-08-12 11:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c: More performance improvements.

2003-08-12 11:45  we7u

	* src/popup_gui.c: Another performance improvement.  Only check for
	  expired popups every two minutes.

2003-08-12 10:29  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c: Another performance improvement.	The timing
	  was set up such that find_zero_position_bulletins() ran every
	  time UpdateTime() was started.  We now wait 15 seconds between
	  each invocation.

2003-08-11 16:57  we7u

	* src/: db.c, messages.c: More optimizations for speed/CPU-usage.
	  Hash table entry creation is now more efficient.
	  Check_and_transmit_messages now gets skipped if we ran it already
	  that second.

2003-08-11 16:15  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added a comment.

2003-08-11 16:05  we7u

	* INSTALL: Added RH9 ImageMagick instructions, courtesy of Wes
	  Johnston.

2003-08-11 15:40  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Moved station # display code from db.c to
	  main.c:UpdateTime() so that the number of stations will
	  accurately reflect our count even when no packets are coming in.

2003-08-11 15:08  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Another performance/CPU-usage tweak.

2003-08-11 14:48  we7u

	* src/main.c: Another performance tweak.  This one lets you handle
	  multiple high-speed 'net connections and keeps up with the
	  receive queues.

2003-08-11 14:07  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Performance enhancements.  Helps Xastir to keep
	  up with very fast network interfaces.

2003-08-11 13:24  we7u

	* src/main.c: Making UpdateTime() run more often, which helps us
	  keep up with fast internet feeds.

2003-08-11 12:57  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing how often we check for stations and messages
	  to expire from our database.	This should also reduce CPU usage.

2003-08-11 11:31  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c: Another CPU-usage tweak.	Running through all
	  of the messages looking for new bulletins every 15 seconds
	  instead of every 2.  Keeps mscan_file() calls down a bit, which
	  is using a lot of CPU if run often.

2003-08-11 07:04  n2ygk

	* src/: awk.c, awk.h, dbfawk.c, dbfawk.h, testawk.c: Save a newer
	  snapshot of in-progress code.  Still not baked.

2003-08-08 18:03  we7u

	* src/db.c: Implementing a 14-bit hash table for station record
	  lookup.  This appears to have a BIG effect on CPU usage.  May be
	  a bit before the codebase is stable again though, but the gains
	  are definitely worth it.  It gives us a feeling for what an SQL
	  database will do for us.

2003-08-08 16:16  we7u

	* src/db.c: Implemented an array of pointers for the station linked
	  list.  Each entry represents one possible starting letter/number
	  for the callsign.  We use this to speed up the search for a
	  particular record, which is our hardest hitter in terms of
	  CPU-usage right now.	This appears to reduce Xastir's CPU
	  requirements by quite a bit, particularly when a lot of stations
	  are in the database.

2003-08-07 13:47  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Backing out one change which broke the port
	  activity symbols.  They're working again now.

2003-08-07 10:01  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: Taking out the awk/dbfawk stuff temporarily
	  until it can be compiled on most systems again.

2003-08-06 17:54  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Another speedup.

2003-08-06 16:19  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Speeding up the loading of symbols.

2003-08-06 16:18  we7u

	* src/lang.c: Breaking out of a loop as soon as we get a non-match.

2003-08-06 10:43  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a note regarding Windows not allowing access
	  to files at times.

2003-08-05 07:34  n2ygk

	* src/: Makefile.am, awk.c, dbfawk.c, dbfawk.h, testawk.c: more
	  dbfawk utility functions.  I'll be integrating this into
	  map_shp.c RSN!

2003-08-04 16:13  we7u

	* src/main.c: Another small change which makes a difference in CPU
	  usage.

2003-08-04 15:36  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Changing draw colors only when necessary.
	  Found this one while profiling using gprof.  May be more to
	  change in this procedure to speed things up a bit..

2003-08-02 10:00  we7u

	* src/main.c: Tweaked Coordinate Calculator so that it checks
	  lat/long minutes/seconds values for negative numbers and >= 60.0.
	  If out-of-range numbers are found, the error text is displayed
	  in the dialog and a warning message is written to STDERR with a
	  bit more detail on the problem found.  Later this STDERR output
	  should probably go to a popup or the main dialog instead, and
	  language strings should be created for them.

2003-07-31 09:01  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c: Making the Close button larger.

2003-07-31 08:21  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c: Made the View->All Messages dialog
	  resizable in both directions.

2003-07-31 06:00  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c: Fixed View->Bulletins dialog so that it is
	  resizable in both directions.

2003-07-27 22:20  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Improved Display Packet Data dialog.  This
	  one is resizable and very fast.  Much better than the previous
	  implementation.

2003-07-26 17:11  we7u

	* symbols/symbols.dat: Added the MODIS Earth Observation symbol.
	  Added a comment specifying where to find the color definitions
	  used for symbols.

2003-07-26 09:35  we7u

	* src/map_dos.c: Commented out some fprintf's that were getting
	  quite verbose when certain Win/DOS maps were loaded.	Warnings
	  were that we were trying to call draw/fill polygon routines with
	  1 or 2 points.

2003-07-25 13:00  we7u

	* src/main.c: Cranked up the delay on REDRAW from 2 to 3 seconds.
	  Changed the dead-reckoning code to schedule a map redraw instead
	  of doing on itself (which probably duplicated some drawing).	CPU
	  usage seems to be down because of these changes.

2003-07-25 11:18  we7u

	* src/gps.c: Improved GPS parsing code.  Fixed buffer overflow
	  problems and restructured code.

2003-07-25 07:36  we7u

	* src/: gps.c, interface.c: Added line-terminations after strncpy()
	  calls and a bunch of comments at those places as well.

2003-07-24 14:18  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding more comments.

2003-07-24 14:14  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Adding uncompressed altitude extension to
	  compressed objects/items.

2003-07-24 09:17  we7u

	* README.win32: Some very minor changes to the Cygwin instructions.

2003-07-24 06:33  n2ygk

	* src/: awk.c, testawk.c, tgrcty.dbfawk, tgrkgl.dbfawk,
	  tgrlk.dbfawk: Add some samples dbfawk files.	Remove incorrect
	  "re" pointer.

2003-07-23 14:34  we7u

	* src/: map_dos.c, map_geo.c, map_gnis.c, map_pdb.c, map_shp.c,
	  map_tif.c, map_tiger.c, maps.c, util.c: We now copy the map
	  pixmap to the display if we're loading maps when the
	  interrupt_drawing_now variable gets set.

2003-07-23 13:29  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Changing the quantites of labels drawn for each
	  zoom level.

2003-07-23 12:17  we7u

	* src/: Makefile.am, map_geo.c, map_tiger.c, maps.c: Fixes for
	  handling various combinations of Xpm/ImageMagick libraries
	  installed/not-installed.  Re-ordered the compile order for the
	  source files to mostly alphabetical order.

2003-07-23 10:33  we7u

	* src/: db.c, location.c, main.c, main.h: Adding more map interrupt
	  capability to tracking and button callback functions.

2003-07-23 09:20  we7u

	* README.win32: Added a note about spaces in
	  filenames/directories/user accounts.

2003-07-22 13:13  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Fixing colors so that generated map files put into
	  the maps/GPS directory will show up properly.

2003-07-22 11:15  we7u

	* README.win32: Changed View to Full for selecting packages.  Added
	  pcre and pcre-devel to the list.

2003-07-22 07:11  n2ygk

	* src/: awk.c, awk.h, testawk.c: add begin, end_rec.  Add some dbf
	  stuff to testawk.c

2003-07-21 09:51  we7u

	* src/awk.c: Initializing a pointer to NULL to get rid of another
	  compiler warning.

2003-07-20 10:44  n2ygk

	* src/: awk.c, awk.h, testawk.c: Make awk.* cleanly compile with
	  -Wall

2003-07-18 14:05  we7u

	* src/: main.h, main.c, maps.c: Setting up code so that the Disable
	  All Maps toggle will immediately take effect while loading maps.

2003-07-18 13:58  we7u

	* configure.ac: Removing -Wall from configure.ac.  Jack Twilley
	  added the correct fix to acinclude.m4.

2003-07-18 13:52  jtwilley

	* acinclude.m4: Wrapped gcc-specific tests in an if test for gcc.
	  Added -Wall to CFLAGS when using gcc.

2003-07-18 13:15  we7u

	* configure.ac: Adding "-Wall" to CFLAGS.  Not sure if this is the
	  perfect way to get it included into src/Makefile, but this method
	  definitely works.

2003-07-18 12:49  we7u

	* src/gps.c: Adding a define necessary before including time.h, in
	  order to get strptime() function defined on some versions of
	  Linux.

2003-07-18 12:12  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Adding casts to first parameter of
	  pthread_cleanup_push() so that after macro substitution the
	  compiler is still happy with the 2nd parameter of
	  _pthread_cleanup_push().

2003-07-18 11:13  we7u

	* INSTALL: Removing tabs.

2003-07-18 06:14  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Moved some stuff around, AGWPE now a
	  section, minor corrections.

2003-07-17 19:29  n2ygk

	* INSTALL, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/awk.c, src/awk.h,
	  src/testawk.c: Start adding support for my awk-like metadata for
	  shapefiles: Tests for -lpcre, documentation of where to find
	  pcre, and awk.c, awk.h which is the code that will be called once
	  I get the nerve to do some serious hacking on map_shp.c:-)

2003-07-17 14:54  we7u

	* README.win32: Added another note about the .cvspass file.

2003-07-17 12:37  we7u

	* src/util.c: Fixing timezone for non Cygwin systems.  #ifdef's
	  were a bit wrong.

2003-07-17 12:25  we7u

	* README.win32: Adding a few more error messages that might occur
	  while doing CVS operations.

2003-07-17 08:28  we7u

	* src/db.c: Making Tropical Storm/Tropical Depression/Hurricane
	  wind speed rings disappear at the ghosting time.

2003-07-16 14:07  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Installing thread cleanup routines.	These
	  should take care of unlocking mutex's when the threads terminate
	  for any reason.  Should keep the rest of the program running.

2003-07-15 22:25  we7u

	* README.win32: Changing the note about creating the .cvsrc file.
	  Trying to make it VERY CLEAR that a Unix-type editor must be
	  used.

2003-07-15 15:58  we7u

	* src/util.c: Changing the begin_critical_section() functio (mutex
	  locks).  If a resource has already been locked, output a warning
	  message and skip trying to lock again.  This should allow Xastir
	  to recover should locks or unlocks be tried twice or more in
	  sequence.  Warning messages will get printed, but the threads
	  should continue to run.

2003-07-15 15:42  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding the busy cursor in a couple of places so that
	  we have a better indication of when map drawing is taking place.

2003-07-15 13:46  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c: Cranking up the GPS
	  timing if it is set lower than 3 seconds.  We also now present a
	  popup to the user to notify them that the GPS timing has been
	  changed.

2003-07-15 13:23  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding a timeout for HSP ports for GPS listener mode.

2003-07-15 12:34  we7u

	* src/interface.c: First attempt at fixing some of the HSP
	  interface's problems.  This one will send strings other than
	  GPGGA and GPRMC through the normal decoding sequence.  That will
	  at least process received TNC strings, which the previous code
	  did not.

2003-07-15 11:13  we7u

	* src/util.c: Skip copying final pixmap to display if we have a map
	  interrupt.

2003-07-15 11:08  we7u

	* src/map_tiger.c: Commenting out a bunc of the map interrupt code
	  to see if it eliminates segfaults that some users are seeing.

2003-07-15 07:17  n2ygk

	* src/: alert.c, color.c, color.h, db.c, list_gui.c, main.c,
	  map_dos.c, map_geo.c, map_gnis.c, map_pdb.c, map_shp.c,
	  map_tif.c, map_tiger.c, maps.c, maps.h, util.c, xa_config.c,
	  xastir.h: Update to newer emacs c-basic-offset

2003-07-14 14:37  we7u

	* README.win32: Changed "diff" to "diffutils", as they apparently
	  changed what package "diff" could be found in.

2003-07-14 14:26  we7u

	* README.win32: Adding a blurb about the final-final dialog for
	  Cygwin installs that must have it's OK button pressed for the
	  whole thing to finish.

2003-07-14 13:31  we7u

	* help/: help-English.dat, help-German.dat, help-Italian.dat,
	  help-Portuguese.dat, help-Spanish.dat: Changing docs to match new
	  /usr/local/share/xastir/* directories.

2003-07-14 13:24  we7u

	* FAQ, INSTALL, README.MAPS, README.win32, UPGRADE: Changing docs
	  to match newer /usr/local/share directory structure.

2003-07-11 08:44  we7u

	* src/util.c: GMT -> Localtime fixes for both Unix and Cygwin.

2003-07-10 13:25  we7u

	* src/util.c: Timezone changes for Cygwin.

2003-07-10 12:06  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changes for HSP.

2003-07-10 12:00  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Forcing expire of severe weather polygons at
	  a 10 minute interval, ignoring the user-settable ghosting period
	  for these objects.

2003-07-09 17:18  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing one comment.

2003-07-09 17:18  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changing some usleep's throughout.  Mostly
	  making them larger, having to do with starting/stopping
	  interfaces.

2003-07-09 17:04  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Backing out a few of the TAB_GROUP items.
	  Don't work for some widgets.	Cause segfaults.  This version
	  appears to work properly.

2003-07-09 16:34  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Setting up tab groups for all of the
	  interface GUI dialogs.

2003-07-09 15:55  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Fixing tab groups for Interfaces->Properties
	  dialog for internet servers.	Probably more to come for other
	  interface types.

2003-07-09 15:26  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Detaching multipoint object drawing from the
	  "Include Expired Data" toggle.  They now expire at the ghosting
	  interval.

2003-07-09 15:02  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Making the default for displaying old data equal
	  to zero now instead of 1.

2003-07-07 16:51  we7u

	* src/main.c: Causing display updates once per 60 seconds, even
	  with no input triggers.

2003-07-07 16:19  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c: Adding in maximum zoom levels for various water
	  features.  They still need fine-tuning.

2003-07-07 14:30  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added a limit to the number of trackpoints displayed in
	  Station Info.  This prevents lockups when display Station Info on
	  extremely long paths, for instance:  TrackMe with GPS enabled,
	  displaying Station Info on my own station.

2003-07-07 14:20  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added in the map interrupt stuff for drawing
	  symbols/tracks.  Maps and symbols/tracks now appear to be drawn &
	  interrupted together.

2003-07-07 13:56  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Tweaks for HSP interfaces.  DTR should be reset
	  now after sending waypoint strings out to the GPS on an HSP port.

2003-07-07 13:23  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changed some comments.

2003-07-07 13:22  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changed a comment.

2003-07-07 11:09  we7u

	* scripts/xastir-fixcfg.sh: Script now removes the map_index.sys
	  file and moves the selected_maps.sys file to
	  selected_maps.sys.backup

2003-07-07 10:57  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changed some comments.

2003-07-07 10:17  we7u

	* scripts/icontable.pl: Changed path to match new Xastir directory
	  structure.

2003-07-07 09:33  we7u

	* UPGRADE: Added instructions for migrating to Xastir's new
	  directory structure.

2003-07-05 08:28  n0vh

	* scripts/fcc-get: Updated to reflect the new directory structure.

2003-07-04 15:17  we7u

	* scripts/xastir-migrate.sh: Changing script so that it deletes the
	  old files and not the new.

2003-07-04 12:32  we7u

	* src/: db.c, location.c, main.c, main.h, map_dos.c, map_geo.c,
	  map_gnis.c, map_pdb.c, map_shp.c, map_tif.c, map_tiger.c, maps.c:
	  A better implementation of the interrupt-map-loading function.
	  We still end up with tracks/stations drawn strangely when we
	  first interrupt, but that's the next problem I'll tackle.

2003-07-04 10:10  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Listing the last few changes...

2003-07-04 02:11  we7u

	* src/main.c: Made some of the mouse and keyboard operations
	  interruptible.

2003-07-03 14:30  we7u

	* src/: map_dos.c, map_geo.c, map_gnis.c, map_pdb.c, map_shp.c,
	  map_tif.c, map_tiger.c: More map interrupting capability.
	  Currently works for resizing quite nicely.

2003-07-03 13:23  we7u

	* src/: map_geo.c, maps.c: Adding in more map drawing interruption
	  capability.

2003-07-03 12:13  we7u

	* src/: main.c, main.h, maps.c: Added some flags that get set by
	  da_resize, which then immediately exits allowing X11 to continue.
	  If interrupt_drawing_now is set, map drawing ceases after the
	  map we're currently loading is finished.  If request_resize is
	  set, then a resize operation is started by UpdateTime.  We can
	  add checks for interrupt_drawing_now to other routines later in
	  order to stop map drawing more quickly.  Next is to do a similar
	  thing for the da_input function, so that a keypress or mouse
	  click can interrupt map loading.

	  personal xastir.cnf references to those shared files.

2003-07-02 14:03  n2ygk

2003-05-13 14:56  jtwilley

	* README.win32: Added Kirk Mefford's suggestion re: creating .cvsrc
	  file

2003-05-12 23:59  we7u

	* src/db.c: CPU Usage fixes.  We no longer do complete symbol
	  updates at a high rate.  We update only the new symbol, then do
	  cleanup at a 60-second rate sometime later.  CPU usage drops a
	  bit with this latest code.

2003-05-12 16:59  we7u

	* src/main.c: Slowed down UpdateTime() iterations so that the
	  read/write threads would have time to do their thing.  Cranked up
	  the maximum packets processed by UpdateTime() in one iteration.
	  Added a usleep() after processing each packet so that the read
	  threads would have time to put another packet in the queue.  CPU
	  time has gone down by these changes, but we still appear to keep
	  up with the incoming packets.

2003-05-12 16:56  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Speeding up the receive threads.  They don't
	  take any CPU time anyway, so this doesn't hurt CPU usage.  They
	  process one line then wait for the main thread to pick it up
	  before they process the next line.

2003-05-12 13:59  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing main.c:UpdateTime() to wait 15ms between
	  each run instead of 10.  This reduces CPU time a bit, yet still
	  allows packets to get processed from the receive queues.  20ms
	  appeared to be too slow.  Will investigate adding longer delays
	  between graphics updates in this routine, yet allowing packet
	  processing to proceed at a fast pace.  That should further reduce
	  CPU cycles yet not get behind in the receive queues.	At that
	  point we might reduce the delay again between UpdateTime() runs.

2003-05-12 12:39  we7u

	* README.win32: Updating the list of Cygwin packages to include

2003-04-25 15:45  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing to "Nonconvex" parameter for the rest of the
	  XFillPolygon calls.  This should speed up drawing a bit.

2003-04-25 15:30  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing XFillPolygons to use Nonconvex parameter,
	  which speeds up map drawing for cases where the line doesn't
	  cross its own path.  Added some comments.

2003-04-25 15:29  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-French.sys,
	  language-Italian.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Correcting one bug
	  left in the files due to a mistyped character.  Checking in
	  latest Italian translation by Marco Calistri, IK5BCU.

2003-04-25 13:36  we7u

	* README.win32, README.1ST: Added notes about libcurl.

2003-04-24 17:25  jtwilley

	* README.win32: Revising the Perl interpreter to install.  There
	  are problems with 5.8.0 yet.

2003-04-23 13:16  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changing port_read() to a 50ms delay instead of
	  20ms.  Last checkin was a slight oops.

2003-04-23 13:15  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Speeding up the port_read() and port_write()
	  delays again.  We were starting to get behind at processing
	  packets from full-feeds, with 100ms delays.  Changed to 50ms
	  delays and we appear to catch up when we get a bit behind.  The
	  correct solution for this is to use select() to wait for data to
	  process, instead of using it as a short sleep function.
	  Something to change another day...

2003-04-22 23:08  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Minor revisions to the create_shapefile from APRS
	  Trail functions.  Maps are now saved in the /maps/GPS/ directory
	  and are red dashed lines by default.	They appear in the Map
	  Chooser once re-index maps has been run.

2003-04-22 10:34  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c, main.h, maps.c, maps.h: The "Store Track"
	  button on the Station Info dialog now saves the station track as
	  a Shapefile map in /var/tmp/, if Shapelib has been compiled in.
	  The Shapefile filename will contain the callsign and a
	  date/timestamp.  The original function of the button still
	  remains as well:  It also saves the info in the original text
	  format.

2003-04-22 01:35  jtwilley

	* src/main.c: Added tnc_data_clean call to static TNC case.

2003-04-22 01:30  jtwilley

	* src/interface.c: Replaced broken routine in tnc_data_clean with
	  working routine.

2003-04-21 15:45  we7u

	  three characters long in order to create a valid match.

2003-04-16 16:42  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, interface_gui.c, location_gui.c, maps.c:

	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/interface.c,
	  src/interface_gui.c: Implemented the transmit radioport option
	  for AGWPE interfaces.  This can be adapted to other multi-port
	  TNC interfaces later.

2003-04-11 13:26  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Backing out one change to avoid high CPU-usage
	  in the port_write() function.  Added comments to the port_read()
	  and port_write() threads to hopefully eliminate this sort of
	  problem in the future.

2003-04-11 11:17  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added code to disable Nagle's algorithm for
	  TCP/IP sockets : TCP_NODELAY setsockopt().

2003-04-11 10:25  we7u

	  debug packets for AGWPE.

2003-04-10 14:17  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,

	  Properties dialog.  Doesn't apply.

2003-04-10 14:05  we7u

	* README.1ST, help/help-English.dat: Adding a few notes about the
	  .GEO file format specifying that decimal degrees are used for
	  lat/lon in these files.

2003-04-08 14:30  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changing input parameter for send_agwpe_packet()
	  to accept a digi path instead of a list of digi's.  This will
	  integrate into the Xastir method of specifiying paths more
	  easily.

2003-04-08 13:33  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changing the AGWPE login ID to be callsign minus
	  SSID (removed SSID).

2003-04-07 23:17  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Initial transmit capability for AGWPE
	  interfaces.  Currently the path is hard-coded to RELAY,WIDE2-2,
	  but that will change given time.  The method of specifying the
	  path differs greatly from Xastir's original method, plus the
	  Properties GUI for AGWPE needs to be reworked to add in the
	  optional path fields.

2003-04-07 10:26  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Commenting out some debugging printf's.

2003-04-06 13:25  we7u

	* src/main.c: The other small tweak needed in order to decode AGWPE
	  packets.

2003-04-06 13:22  we7u

	* src/interface.c: AGWPE interface receive mode is not functional.
	  Transmit is still being worked on.

2003-04-05 11:16  we7u

	* src/interface.c: More AGWPE code.  We're getting packets sent in
	  both directions now, although the login/password packet doesn't
	  appear to be accepted properly yet.  No decoding/encoding of real
	  packets is implemented yet.

2003-04-04 16:55  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Fixing this so that it handles the correct types
	  of interfaces.

2003-04-04 14:04  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added some comments.

2003-04-04 13:50  we7u

	* src/interface.c: More AGWPE stuff.  Not functional yet.

2003-04-04 12:52  we7u

	  passwd string has something in it.

2003-04-04 11:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c: More AGWPE interface code.  Now sending
	  login/password string and command to ask AGWPE to send us the
	  monitored packets.  Don't have transmit or the receive decode of
	  those packets completed yet, but debug code is in place that
	  looks for complete headers and packets and notifies us on
	  reception.

2003-04-03 23:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c: More AGWPE stuff.  Not functional yet.

2003-04-03 17:12  we7u

	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/interface.c, src/interface.h,
	  src/interface_gui.c: Initial steps at adding network support for
	  AGWPE.

2003-04-03 12:57  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.h: Adding my test_create_shapefile stuff back
	  in, this time with the proper #ifdef's so that everybody can
	  still compile the code whether they have shapelib installed or
	  not.

2003-04-03 11:52  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c: Spawning off a separate thread for doing
	  the Snapshot() function.

2003-04-03 09:39  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing the Snapshot function so that it can reduce
	  to 256 colors if necessary when converting from XPM to PNG.

2003-04-02 13:01  francais1

	* src/interface.c: Enable suid privileges around bind to reset from
	  callsign (RELAY digipeat bugfix with 2.2.19 kernels, I hope.)

2003-04-02 11:30  we7u

	* src/main.c: Disabling my test_create_shapefile_map entry.  Some
	  people can't get Xastir to compile with it in there, and it's
	  test code anyway.

2003-04-01 16:27  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, maps.h: Testing of the shapefile creation
	  function.  Attached to the "Test" button on the menus.

2003-04-01 15:25  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changed to comments.  No code changes.

2003-04-01 13:13  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Adding some white space.  No code changes this
	  time.

2003-04-01 09:55  we7u

	* src/xastir.h: Enabling serial KISS tnc relay digipeat
	  functionality by default.  Initial testing shows that this
	  portions of relay digipeat is working.  AX.25 relay digipeat
	  still needs a bit of work to get the source callsign to be set
	  properly.

2003-04-01 01:09  we7u

	* src/: db.c, interface.c: Changes to make RELAY digipeating
	  functional for Serial KISS TNC interfaces.  May have fixed AX.25
	  interfaces as well.

2003-03-31 23:16  we7u

	* src/db.c: Better debug output for relay_digipeat() function.

2003-03-31 15:31  we7u

	* src/db.c: More debug messages for relay_digipeat() function.
	  Again, will be removed later.

2003-03-31 14:59  we7u

	* src/db.c: Adding some debug output for relay digipeat.  It'll be
	  removed later when we get things working properly.

2003-03-28 17:05  we7u

	* src/db.c: More KISS variant comments.

2003-03-28 16:37  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added another kiss variant to the comments.

2003-03-28 16:34  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added some notes about KISS protocol variants.  No code
	  changes.

2003-03-28 11:13  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing point shapefiles so that if labels are
	  turned off, the symbols still get drawn.

2003-03-28 10:33  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, db.c: Added comments.  Now mask off the AX.25
	  P/F bit before checking the control byte for 0x03 (UI Frame).
	  Now drop the Serial KISS packet if the final result is not 0x03.

2003-03-27 15:57  we7u

	* src/db.c: Taking out the control byte == 0x03 restriction for
	  Serial KISS packets.	MKISS TNC's encode the channel number in
	  the control byte.

2003-03-27 15:46  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added a note to decode_ax25_header() function.

2003-03-27 15:42  we7u

	* README.1ST: Added a GPSMan install step to set the permissions on
	  the /usr/local/xastir/maps/GPS/ directory so that files could be
	  written there.

2003-03-27 15:33  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changing the Serial KISS interface to ignore packets if
	  the control byte != 0x03 and the PID byte != 0x0f.  This will
	  make it co-exist on channels that might have other protocols on
	  them (net/rom, tcp/ip, etc.).  The AX.25 interface code already
	  had the PID==0x0f restriction on it.

2003-03-27 14:32  we7u

	* README.win32: Changed "go.bat" to just "go".	Less typing to get
	  things rolling that way.

2003-03-27 14:16  we7u

	* README.win32: Added zip/unzip to the list of packages to install.
	  Helps when installing some map files later.

	* README.win32: More details for the user in terms of creating
	  subdirectories while adding in the optional libraries.

2003-03-26 11:55  we7u

	* Makefile.am: Added the xastir/maps/GPS/ directory to the
	  directories created during install.  This directory is required
	  for GPSMan to operate with Xastir properly.

2003-03-26 11:28  we7u

	* src/main.c: Updating about message to contain 2003 instead of
	  2002.

2003-03-26 10:41  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing the method of parameter passing between
	  GPS_operations() and gps_transfer_thread() in order to solve a
	  user's problem.

2003-03-26 10:00  we7u

	* src/main.c: A few minor tweaks to GPS_operations and
	  gps_transfer_thread, mostly to debug problems with parameter
	  passing.

2003-03-24 15:28  we7u

	  Must rename the libtiff dll's in order to be compatible with the
	  version of libgeotiff.

2003-03-24 13:36  we7u

	* README.win32: Removed warning note above the geotiff

	  to streamline configure.ac, with attendant changes in various
	  source files.

2003-03-18 14:59  we7u

	* src/: db.c, interface_gui.c, xastir.h: Tweaks to enable testing
	  of RELAY digipeat with serial KISS TNC's.  One define in xastir.h
	  needs to be changed in order to enable it.

	* configure.ac: Another ImageMagick tweak for Cygwin.

2003-03-17 12:39  we7u

	  currently recognizing the ImageMagick libraries installed in
	  /usr/lib.

2003-03-16 23:29  we7u

	* src/main.c: We now call reload_object_item() after we clear all

	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/gps.c, src/interface.c,
	  src/main.c: Added a popup when GPS data goes stale.  We now allow
	  one posit when GPS interfaces are first enabled before we
	  consider the data stale and disable transmit of My Position.
	  Removed the statusline messages that happen when we successfully
	  decode GPRMC or GPGGA sentences:  They were causing too much CPU
	  time on Yellow Dog Linux (powerPC).

2003-03-05 16:39  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Fix the case where someone plays with a GPS
	  interface and then turns it off again.  Before this change,
	  posits would be disabled unless GPS interface was re-enabled that
	  had good data coming in, or unless the user restarted Xastir.

2003-03-05 15:32  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,

	  normal use yet.

2003-03-04 15:55  we7u

	* src/main.c: Converted to switch statement in new GPS transfer
	  routines.  Can now because it's an int.

2003-03-04 15:42  we7u

	* src/main.c: Separated the GPS transfer functions into their own
	  thread.  GPS transfers now run concurrently with the other
	  threads, updating the map view when they complete.

2003-03-04 12:34  we7u

	* README.1ST: More Cygwin libproj and libgeotiff notes.

2003-02-27 15:52  we7u

	* README.1ST: More Cygwin notes.  libgeotiff stuff.

2003-02-27 15:31  we7u

	* README.1ST: More changes for Cygwin.	Installation of Proj.4 now
	  complete and documented.  I'm still working on installation of
	  libgeotiff.

2003-02-27 12:53  we7u

	* src/main.c: Preliminary support for GPSMan:  Downloads track,
	  creates Shapefile map, auto-imports and displays said map in
	  Xastir.  Requires pre-release GPSMan plus gpsmanshp.tgz file
	  installed.  Also requires that the "WE7U" define at the top of
	  main.c be defined to put the new code into operation.

2003-02-27 09:39  we7u

	* configure.ac: Added a tweak to look for the Shapelib include file
	  in subdirectory _not_ ending in /libshp/

2003-02-26 10:09  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h: Removing dead code.  Changed/added a few
	  comments and debug messages.	Removed prototypes from alert.h
	  that aren't being used.

2003-02-26 09:38  we7u

	* configure.ac: Taking out extra X11 include path that was just
	  added for linux recently.

2003-02-25 17:55  we7u

	* src/: bulletin_gui.c, bulletin_gui.h, db.c, db.h: Fixes for
	  bulletin popups.

2003-02-25 13:45  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changes to comments only.

2003-02-25 12:50  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h, db.c, maps.c: Changing NWS weather alerts
	  so that they are no longer stored in the message database and
	  rescanned periodically.  They now go straight to the alert_list.

2003-02-25 10:04  we7u

	* src/: bulletin_gui.c, bulletin_gui.h: Fixing another bug having
	  to do with zero-distance bulletins popping up when the user
	  settings tell Xastir not to.

2003-02-25 09:31  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added Map Display Bookmarks button to right-click
	  mouse menu.

2003-02-24 23:03  we7u

	* configure.ac: Adding a path for Linux configure to help find
	  Motif include files on some systems.

2003-02-24 22:30  kd6zwr

	* ChangeLog, src/db.c: Made my_station_gps_change update sec_heard
	  to fix DR of my station.

2003-02-24 16:41  we7u

	* configure.ac: Adding /usr/X11R6/include/Xm as an include path for
	  Motif/Lesstif for Slackware 8.1.  May need additional things in
	  order to link to the library as well.

2003-02-24 16:29  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added more comments.

2003-02-24 16:26  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added some comments.

2003-02-24 15:40  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Getting rid of unneeded code.

2003-02-24 15:40  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added some comments.

2003-02-24 15:26  we7u

	* src/: db.c, maps.c, maps.h: Starting to change the weather alert
	  code to make it independent of the message database.	Part-way to
	  that goal.  This version just relocates the weather alerts scan
	  of the message database into the db.c code at the point where we
	  received the alert.  The next step is to just throw the alert
	  onto the alert_list and skip the message database portion
	  altogether.  This current code appears to still be fully
	  functional w.r.t. weather alerts.

2003-02-24 14:45  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Re-org of a bit of code w.r.t. weather alerts (no
	  major changes though).  Lots of comment changes.

2003-02-24 13:58  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Tweaks to watch boxes for Gerry Wheeler.

2003-02-24 13:35  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Removed dead code.  Changed some comments.

2003-02-24 13:04  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, maps.c: Changes to comments only.

2003-02-24 12:46  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, main.c: Setting the proper variables so that a
	  screen update happens in a timely manner after WX alerts expire.

2003-02-24 12:23  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, main.c, maps.c, wx_gui.c: We now expire wx alerts
	  only in main.c:UpdateTime(), and only every 60 seconds.  If any
	  are expired, it schedules a screen update.

2003-02-24 11:41  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h, maps.c: More minor work on wx alerts.

2003-02-24 11:28  jtwilley

	* ChangeLog: Added entry for change made to src/interface.c

2003-02-24 11:25  jtwilley

	* src/interface.c: Changed timeouts to 100 milliseconds from 100
	  microseconds.

2003-02-24 10:25  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h, maps.c, wx_gui.c, xa_config.c: Moved
	  alert expiration code into common alert_expire() function.

2003-02-23 08:58  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Making an int more global.  Needed for wx alert
	  expire code elsewhere.

2003-02-23 08:56  we7u

	* src/alert.h: Adding an extern int that other code needs now for
	  wx alert expiration.

2003-02-23 08:48  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Changed a comment.

2003-02-23 08:44  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Another tweak to wx alert expiration.

2003-02-23 08:40  we7u

	* src/wx_gui.c: Another small tweak to expiration for wx alerts.

2003-02-23 08:37  we7u

	* src/util.c: Tweaking the alert expiration stuff some more.

2003-02-23 01:52  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h, maps.c, util.c, wx_gui.c: Fixed incorrect
	  expiration times for weather alerts.	Proper local expiration
	  time is now computed and stored.  View->WX Alerts dialog appears
	  to update correctly as alerts come and go.  Weather alert slots
	  get re-used by new alerts properly.  We might have incorrect
	  expiration times for weather alerts twice a year when daylight
	  savings time switches though.

2003-02-22 08:41  n0vh

	* src/main.c: Fixed the intensity slider since 0 was causing xastir
	  to crash.  Set the minimum to something reasonable.

2003-02-21 17:16  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c: Added a new button the
	  Stations menu:  Reload Object/Item History.

2003-02-21 16:58  we7u

	* src/sound.c: Adding some spacing.  No code changes.

2003-02-21 15:53  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h, maps.c, wx_gui.c: Fixes to weather
	  alerts.  Should re-use weather alert slots in the array now, and
	  should expire things properly as well.

2003-02-21 12:46  we7u

	* configure.ac: Modifying the error messages to make them
	  consistent and provide useful info to the user.

2003-02-21 11:47  we7u

	* configure.ac: Taking out some commented-out code and some
	  irrelevant comments.

2003-02-20 21:10  n0vh

	* src/main.c: Logging indicator now changes color to highlight that
	  it's logging.

2003-02-20 20:31  n0vh

	* src/: main.c, main.h: Added a status text box at the bottom of
	  the window that indicates that xastir is logging to disk.

2003-02-20 15:31  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c: A few fixes for bulletins.  Also added a
	  callback for the togglebutton on the View->Bulletins dialog.

2003-02-20 14:34  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added a debugging message.

2003-02-20 14:18  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing the "Test" function a bit.

2003-02-20 12:00  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c: Changing time between receiving a new
	  bulletin and checking whether it is within our range:  From 15
	  seconds to 60 seconds.  This actually delays our getting notice
	  of each new bulletin, but helps to prevent popping up bulletins
	  when a bulletin comes in and then a posit comes in later for that
	  station (putting that station outside our range).  The cause of
	  the bulletin window popping up appears to be these
	  inside-our-range/ outside-our-range-when-a-posit-comes-in
	  bulletins.

2003-02-20 11:32  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changed/added some comments.  No code changes.

2003-02-20 10:31  we7u

	* configure.ac: Added more search paths for Solaris 8/9 binaries.

2003-02-20 02:10  we7u

	* bootstrap.sh: Added status messages.

2003-02-20 01:51  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, bulletin_gui.c, db.c, draw_symbols.c, gps.c,

	  snprintf.c, track_gui.c, util.c, view_message_gui.c, wx_gui.c,
	  xa_config.c: Added comments.

2003-02-20 01:45  we7u

	  hostname.h, igate.h, list_gui.h, main.h, maps.h, rotated.h,
	  snprintf.h, track_gui.h, util.h, wx.h, xastir.h: Added comments.

2003-02-20 01:00  we7u

	* src/: maps.c, track_gui.c, util.c: More fixes for calling
	  external programs.

2003-02-20 00:33  we7u

	* src/: maps.c, track_gui.c, util.c: Checking for existence of
	  external programs before trying to invoke them.  If they don't
	  exist, we call "echo" instead (relatively harmless).

2003-02-19 23:56  we7u

2003-02-18 13:33  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am: Moving the AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS to before the line
	  continuation char.  It doesn't work where it was put.  Is it
	  necessary?  Should it be somewhere else in the file?

	* configure.ac: Added some debugging info back in.  Commented out
	  so a typical user won't be bothered by it.

2003-02-10 10:54  we7u

	* src/db.c: A fix by Reuven w.r.t. setting the messaging-capable

2003-02-05 23:57  we7u

	  Changed all printf's to write to stderr instead of stdout

2003-02-03 19:52  jtwilley

2003-02-03 14:29  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/igate.c, src/main.c: Separated
	  the timing sliders from the Configure->Defaults dialog, making a
	  new Configure->Timing dialog out of them.

2003-02-03 13:12  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing max posit rate to every 60 minutes instead
	  of every 45.

2003-02-03 12:56  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added separate object/item TX timer and associated
	  slider in Configure->Defaults.  Now people with WX stations that
	  want to transmit every 5 minutes can set their object/item TX
	  rate separately.  Also changed the posit rate slider to go from
	  0.5 to 45 minutes (30 seconds to 45 minutes).

2003-02-03 12:21  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c, main.h, util.c, xa_config.c: Separate TX
	  timer for objects and items.	New slider in Configure->Defaults
	  for it as well.  Probably needs more testing to assure that it's
	  working correctly.

2003-02-03 11:38  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, main.c, main.h: Added a slider for setting the
	  dead-reckoning timeout value.

2003-02-03 11:21  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changed Configure->Defaults timing values to sliders.
	  Makes the code much simpler plus gives the users more options in
	  setting the values.

2003-02-02 23:21  jtwilley

	* acinclude.m4, config.guess, config.sub, missing, mkinstalldirs:

	  Modified files to work with autoconf 2.53.  There are some minor
	  bugs still, but they are being worked on.

2003-02-02 23:19  jtwilley

	* COPYING: Changed example to be Y2K-compliant.

2003-02-02 23:19  jtwilley

	* ChangeLog:

	  Updated autoconf files for new version.  Fixed COPYING Y2K
	  distraction.

2003-02-02 21:49  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, draw_symbols.c, xa_config.c: Added
	  DEAD_RECKONING_TIMEOUT value to xastir.cnf.  The function is no
	  longer tied to the ghosting interval.

2003-02-02 21:05  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, xa_config.c: Added a global variable
	  st_direct_timeout which is saved in the config file.	This
	  specifies the timeout value for the ST_DIRECT bit.

2003-02-02 08:42  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added comments around the ST_DIRECT bit
	  setting/clearing code.  Change the ST_DIRECT bit timeout from 1
	  minute to 1 hour.  This gives stations that transmit only every
	  30 minutes (common) a chance to be seen as an ST_DIRECT station.
	  As the comments show in that section of code, that timeout value
	  will in the future probably change into a global variable that is
	  set within the config file.

2003-02-01 23:22  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixed a pointer-to-integer comparison (compiler
	  warning).  Reformatted the code per Xastir project specs.

2003-02-01 20:45  jtwilley

	* ChangeLog:

	  Updated ChangeLog for solution for request ID #678322

2003-02-01 20:42  jtwilley

	* src/db.h:

	  Added direct_heard variable to station data structure.  This
	  variable is set each time a direct packet is received from a
	  station.

2003-02-01 20:40  jtwilley

	* src/db.c:

	  Removed old support for direct stations and added new complete
	  direct station support.  Paths with WIDE and TRACE entries of all
	  kinds are properly checked for directness.

2003-02-01 02:14  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/db.h, src/interface.c,
	  src/main.c, src/util.c: Partial fixes for GUI lockups due to lots
	  of locally-controlled objects: Moved delays in interface routine
	  so that they'd only take effect if the interface was up and
	  transmit was enabled (both global and per-interface transmit
	  controls).  Added a statusline() the lets us know when we're
	  retransmitting our objects/items.  Delayed transmit of our items
	  for 30 seconds after initial startup.  We will still have delays
	  each POSIT_interval when our objects get sent:  Something like 2
	  seconds * number of up/tx-enabled interfaces * number of objects.

2003-01-31 17:04  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Added code to prevent wind barbs from getting
	  drawn if their position is off-screen.

2003-01-30 17:17  we7u

	* src/db.c: Adding code to assure that locally-controlled objects
	  don't expire.

2003-01-30 16:15  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Reducing the length of the filtering input
	  box to 190.

2003-01-30 14:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Checking for NULL pointer for filter_string.

2003-01-30 14:09  we7u

2002-12-31 13:57  we7u

	* src/: draw_symbols.c, maps.c, util.c: Speeding up get_line again
	  (don't need all the filtering anymore since the Map Chooser bug
	  was found).  Fixing get_line() calls so that the arrays are long
	  enough to contains what's read from file.

2002-12-30 11:06  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fixing segfaults that could occur if GNIS files had
	  short lines or lines containing control characters.  Now checking
	  for NULL returns from index() calls.

2002-12-29 16:36  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat:
	  More updates to "whats new" section; typo fixes.

2002-12-29 15:04  rzg

	  changes: Reorganized and cleaned up README.1ST, updated some
	  portions as needed. Updated helpfile for map chooser changes.

	  Still need more README work, especially doing something with all
	  that security stuff and perhaps the OS specific stuff. And the
	  helpfile "Whats new" needs to be written more nicely, I started
	  but ran out of time.

2002-12-28 15:41  kd6zwr

	* src/maps.c: Changed the sscanf fix... cleared the string to all
	  nulls before sscanf.	The temp string broke solaris... *sigh*.
	  This works everywhere now??

2002-12-28 12:55  kd6zwr

	* src/maps.c: Added a temp string to avoid a sscanf bug(?) to

	  map_index data to disk.

2002-12-26 16:33  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Looking for all control characters instead of just
	  '\r' or '\n'.  Added another warning message if control chars are
	  found.  Changed some comments.

2002-12-25 07:32  we7u

	* src/: draw_symbols.c, main.c, maps.c: Added error checking at the
	  points where different xbitmap files were being loaded, and where

	  before croaking if these files are not present.

2002-12-24 17:26  we7u

	* src/: maps.c, util.c: More filtering changes in and around

	  map_index.sys.

2002-12-23 00:16  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Initial implementation of the draw_filled flag in the
	  map drawing routines which can make use of it.

2002-12-22 11:24  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Deleting dead code.  Adding comments.  Set a pointer
	  to NULL after calling a routine that might free the memory space.

2002-12-22 10:54  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changed function which reads map_index.sys in from
	  disk so that it forces a sorted order for in-memory map list.

2002-12-21 23:29  we7u

	* src/maps.c: More error-checking while creating map indexes.

2002-12-21 08:25  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added comments.  Changed a few compares to read
	  better.  No real code changes.

2002-12-21 08:08  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added more error-checking and debug output to the map
	  indexing routines.

2002-12-21 00:27  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c: Fully functional automaps selection from
	  the Map Chooser->Properties dialog.

2002-12-21 00:08  we7u

	* src/main.c: More automaps stuff.  Can now tweak the value in the
	  map_index.sys file from the Map Chooser->Properties dialog.
	  Back-end code still has to be written to use this information.

2002-12-20 23:46  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, maps.h: Adding automaps enable/disable to
	  the Map Chooser->Properties dialog.  More to do yet.

2002-12-20 22:38  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added some debug lines.

2002-12-20 21:40  we7u

	* src/main.c: Moved some of the widgets to the bottom rowcol form
	  in the Map Properties dialog.

2002-12-20 17:18  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.h: Map Chooser->Properties now brings up new
	  dialog which allows setting map layers and draw_filled fields.
	  draw_filled is not used yet in the code.

2002-12-20 12:59  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,

2002-12-20 12:36  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added some comments.

2002-12-20 12:07  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changing the manual map index button back to its
	  original code, where it only updates the map index instead of
	  re-indexing from scratch.  This keeps the manually-tweaked
	  map_level & draw_filled fields intact.  The original reason for
	  starting from scratch was to remove deleted maps.  This happens
	  anyway after two Xastir restarts, so starting the list from
	  scratch isn't really needed anyway.

2002-12-20 11:52  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fixes to re-indexing so that files and directories
	  get good default values in the index.

2002-12-20 11:52  we7u

2002-12-19 17:04  we7u

	* src/: main.c, main.h, maps.c: Initial attempt at sorting/drawing
	  maps based on map layer.  It works! Next step is to get some more
	  GUI hooks for it so that the user can specify which maps go on
	  which layer, and which layers to enable for drawing.

2002-12-19 12:36  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c: Added a count of how
	  many maps are currently selected to the map chooser.	Doesn't
	  quite work the way I'd like yet, but it is useful.  It shows how
	  many maps are marked in the in-memory map index as selected.
	  That quantity can change when you tweak things in the map chooser

	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c, src/maps.h: More tweaks
	  to the Map Chooser.  Fully resizable now.  Add new button at the
	  top which will eventually be used to change map properties.
	  Changed how the "None" button works, and renamed it to "Clear".

2002-12-15 23:56  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Yet another attempt to clean up garbage that some
	  people are seeing in the map index.  In this tweak I check the
	  sscanf call to make sure that the proper number of fields have
	  been parsed from each input line.  If not, that record in the
	  map_index is dropped.

2002-12-15 23:07  we7u

	* README.1ST: Tweaks by Tate, KC7ZRU.  Thanks!

2002-12-15 23:03  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changed map re-indexing button so that it deletes the
	  entire in-memory index, then re-creates it from scratch.  It is
	  slower than the old method, but guarantees that deleted/added
	  maps will show up in the map chooser without have to restart
	  Xastir to do it.

2002-12-15 21:41  we7u

	* src/festival.c: Change to some debug code.

2002-12-15 18:28  we7u

	* src/festival.c: Now doing a check in the festival code for
	  duplicate strings.  Only one string is held in the queue for 30
	  seconds.  If the same string comes in, festival refuses to speak
	  it.

2002-12-14 21:34  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c: Better implementation of map directory
	  select/de-select in the Map Chooser.

2002-12-14 15:04  we7u

	* src/maps.c: A few small tweaks to how map_index strings get
	  created for directories.

2002-12-14 00:16  we7u

	* src/main.c: Commented out a couple of debugging statements.

2002-12-13 23:52  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c: First functional version of Map Chooser
	  where clicking on a directory will select all maps below it.
	  Still a few bugs left to squash, but it works!

2002-12-13 22:35  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Finished getting map directories to show up properly
	  and in sorted order in the Map Chooser.  They're selectable as

	  directories when selected/de-selected.  Not fully functional yet.

2002-12-13 17:04  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Starting to implement storage of map directories in

2002-12-13 12:04  we7u

	* src/main.c: Tweaks to comments.

2002-12-13 09:42  we7u

	* src/main.c: Including Chris Bell's new routines for
	  directory-at-a-time map file selection.  These routines are not
	  integrated into Xastir yet.  They need to be tweaked to fit into
	  the new map_index method of map selection, and the Lesstif/Motif
	  functions need to be combined into one function.  This is a work
	  in progress.

2002-12-10 14:51  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fix for dead-reckoning for compressed objects/items.

2002-12-10 14:13  we7u

	  order to start using it.

2002-12-10 13:15  we7u

	* README.1ST: Added a note about James Jefferson's nice world map
	  in Shapefile format.

2002-12-10 12:48  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixed to map chooser.  Changes now apply only to the

	  help fix buffer overflows in several areas of the code.  Some of
	  them may have been caused by get_line() in util.c, which has been
	  rewritten to prevent overflowing the string passed into it.  Also
	  added a new define: MAX_FILENAME, which is used to declare sizes

2002-11-25 23:05  we7u

	  the posits for that station are received.

2002-11-25 17:10  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h: Start of trying to fix distance=0 bulletins for
	  when posit comes in later.  A bit more code to write, but this
	  keeps track of whether or now the posit is currently known.

2002-11-25 13:19  we7u

	  control the same global variable:  One toggle on the
	  Configure->Defaults dialog, and another on the View->Bulletins

2002-11-23 22:11  we7u

	* src/util.c: Tweaks to the speech stuff so that we don't add
	  commas to the SSID portion of a callsign.  This makes it speak
	  -12 as "dash twelve".

2002-11-23 20:20  we7u

	* README.1ST: Added a blurb about festival and starting it in
	  server mode.	Useful for those that can't read the English help
	  file (where it is also documented).

2002-11-23 08:18  we7u

	* src/util.c: Speech stuff now looks for a number in the text
	  (before a dash).  If found, it adds commas so that Festival will
	  speak each letter.  If not found, it feeds the string directly to
	  Festival to let it try to pronounce it.

2002-11-21 10:20  we7u

	* src/util.c: Minor tweak to make sure that objects/items only get

	  ~.xastir/config/object.log file.

2002-11-19 10:29  francais1

	* src/: main.c, main.h, xa_config.c: Added "hidden" conf file value
	  to adjust DR update rate Default is 30 s

2002-11-19 10:20  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixes so that dead-reckoning and "Display Moving
	  Stations" work properly even when we only have one position from
	  a station.  They are now classified with ST_MOVING flag if the
	  speed is non-zero.

2002-11-19 09:59  we7u

	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/draw_symbols.c, src/main.c,
	  src/main.h, src/xa_config.c: Added new buttons to enable/disable
	  the different dead-reckoning display objects.  This allows users
	  to get the display as cluttered or uncluttered as they like.

2002-11-19 09:10  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Changing default for dead-reckoning to ON.

2002-11-18 16:25  francais1

	* src/: draw_symbols.c, main.c: Added call to draw_symbols in
	  UpdateTime at least every 30 s if dead reckoning drawing is
	  turned on.  Tweaked dead reckoning graphics to draw the DR trail
	  in a dashed line and draw an arc that gets larger as time from
	  last posit grows until it turns into a circle.

2002-11-18 13:19  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Fixing the bug where weather stations hit the
	  clear interval but wind barbs still get drawn.

2002-11-17 21:48  kd6zwr

	* src/main.c: added keysyms for pgup/pgdn on sun keyboards

2002-11-14 18:02  we7u

	* src/util.c: Code to handle disowning of object that other people
	  take over, and to comment out our own objects from the object.log
	  file when we delete them.  This keeps us from retransmitting the
	  objects when Xastir restarts.

2002-11-14 16:25  we7u

	* src/: main.c, util.c, util.h: More object stuff.  More to do yet.

2002-11-14 15:50  we7u

	* src/: db.c, util.c, util.h: The start of code to allow disowning
	  an object that someone else is assuming control over.  Xastir
	  already does this while running, but it doesn't write the data to
	  the object.log file, so when it starts up, it owns the object
	  again.

2002-11-14 14:07  we7u

	* src/db.c: Saving empty-string for speed instead of "0" if speed
	  is unknown on a parsed packet.

2002-11-14 12:40  we7u

	  Initial implementation of dead-reckoning by J. Lance Cotton,
	  KJ5O.  Thanks very much to him for doing this!!!

2002-11-13 15:31  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Forcing terraserver map extents in the index to be at
	  the edges of the earth.  Added more statusline messages for
	  loading/indexing maps (more consistent now).

2002-11-13 14:13  we7u

	* src/maps.c: An attempt to fix the buffer overflow problems with
	  map indexing.

2002-11-13 13:19  we7u

	* src/main.c: We now delete/recreate our own station record only if
	  we change our callsign.  All other changes just cause an update
	  to the current record.

2002-11-13 12:43  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: New "Waiting for
	  GPS data.." string.

2002-11-13 12:40  we7u

	* src/: db.c, interface.c, main.c, main.h: Implemented a countdown
	  from when GPS data goes invalid.  It is decremented each time a
	  posit occurs.  When it reaches zero, posits stop.  Valid GPS data
	  parsing will reset it back to the starting count.  Also reduced
	  the size of the tracked station circles in order to more easily
	  read the station data.

2002-11-12 18:23  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added another blue circle for tracked stations.  Now
	  three concentric circles.

2002-11-12 18:17  we7u

	* src/db.c: Making a tracked station have both a yellow and red
	  circle to make it easier to see against different map
	  backgrounds.

2002-11-12 18:07  we7u

	* src/: db.c, interface.c, main.c, main.h: Added
	  "my_position_valid" variable, initially set to 1.  As soon as a
	  GPS interface of any type is started up, this variable gets set
	  to zero, and it holds off posits.  Once the first valid GPS
	  position is parsed, this variable is again set to 1, and posits
	  proceed normally.  As Xastir comes up, interfaces are brought up
	  before the first posit, so if a GPS interface is enabled on
	  startup, no posits will occur until the first GPS posit is parsed
	  properly.  This variable could be used later to disable posits
	  when GPS data becomes unusable or stops coming in.  This feature
	  is not implemented yet though.

2002-11-12 15:23  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changed tracked stations circle from Red to Yellow to
	  make it easier for partially colorblind people to see against a
	  background of topo maps.

2002-11-12 14:56  we7u

	* src/db.c: Got rid of another bug off the buglist.  Now only
	  stations that are currently visible will be selected for Station
	  Info operations.

2002-11-12 14:15  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changed the order of startup so that map indexing is
	  completed before interfaces are brought up.

2002-11-12 10:56  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changes intended to keep variables from going
	  out-of-bounds.  I'm attempting to get more DRG-Enhanced map
	  formats working.  These changes don't quite make them work, but
	  they do make it better and catch some out-of-bounds problems.

2002-10-29 14:26  we7u

	* src/db.c: Tweaks to the wind direction/wind speed decoding for

	  Expanded "Display Stations" into "Display Local Stations" and
	  "Display Non-Local Stations"

2002-10-20 18:06  francais1

	* src/: db.c, interface.c, interface_gui.c: First pass at relay
	  digipeating over an ax25 interface.  Look for the define
	  I_WANT_TO_TRY_AX25_RELAY_DIGIPEAT in db.c and interface_gui.c

2002-10-19 12:06  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/main.c: Added an ID
	  string to the status line for the periods when no traffic is
	  coming in.  If the ID string doesn't appear for 9 minutes
	  straight, it is forced onto the statusline for a few seconds in
	  order to meet ID requirements.  This is useful for beaming an
	  Xastir image over amateur fast-scan television.  Tweaked the
	  Configure->Station callsign block so that all characters of a
	  full callsign plus SSID are displayed.  Tweaked the weather
	  symbol display code so that "   " and "..." are not taken to be a
	  zero reading.

2002-10-18 15:42  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changes in the GNIS map-reading code to accomodate
	  the lack of consistency in how the GNIS files are formatted.

2002-10-18 14:04  we7u

	* README.1ST: Added a note from Chris about GNIS file.

2002-10-18 12:34  we7u

	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c: Broke up Stations menu
	  into submenus.

2002-10-18 10:13  we7u

	* src/main.c: Set default ON for new togglebuttons on stations
	  menu.

2002-10-17 22:30  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,

	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/main.c, src/main.h:
	  Initial attempt at some station/object display filtering.  What
	  is coded so far works, but most of the variables are not saved in
	  the config file yet.	May need more togglebuttons & variables
	  implemented yet.

2002-10-17 15:41  we7u

	* AUTHORS: Minor cleanups and added a few contributors.

2002-10-17 15:23  we7u

	  point in the file.

2002-10-17 15:05  we7u

	* src/db.c: Tweaks to get rid of compiler warnings for Debian/S390.
	  Changed char's to int's and got rid of some casts.

2002-10-17 12:13  we7u

	* config/language-Portuguese.sys: Changes by David Quental, CT1DRB.

2002-10-16 14:10  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added draw_symbol_filtered() function.  Will eventually
	  add code to this function which implements display filtering.

2002-10-15 14:28  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.c, draw_symbols.h: Implemented different
	  colors for tropical storm/depression and hurricane packets, for
	  the three different wind speeds:  Green = gale force wind radius,
	  yellow = tropical storm wind radius, red = hurricane wind radius.

2002-10-15 13:38  we7u

	* src/db.c: Converted storm circles from nautical miles to miles
	  before calling draw_pod_circle.  Ranges are now correct.  Added a
	  couple of comments as well regarding things yet to be done.

2002-10-11 16:25  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Added a comment about Dallas rain gauge.

2002-10-11 12:55  we7u

	* src/db.c: Initial attempt at drawing circles around storm objects
	  (radius of winds).  Need to convert from nautical miles to miles
	  and perhaps change to a different method of drawing, but this
	  works for now.

2002-10-11 12:54  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Commented out a debug line.

2002-10-11 12:53  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Correction to temperature conversion for Dallas WX
	  station.

2002-10-10 15:19  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Support for wind direction for Dallas WX station (using
	  OWW daemon for the data feed).

2002-10-10 13:40  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Now handle 0x00 characters in port_read, for the
	  case where the One-Wire Weather daemon ("OWW") sends them to us.
	  Temperature from a Dallas one-wire station is now initially coded
	  and appears to be working.

2002-10-10 13:38  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Changed some comments and put one message under
	  debug_level control.

2002-10-10 13:05  francais1

	* src/util.c: phg_decode was missing the phg circle radius/2 stuff
	  put into phg_decode.

2002-10-10 01:48  we7u

	* src/: db.h, wx.c: Initial support for Dallas One-Wire weather
	  station.  Xastir gets it's data from the OWW server.	We
	  currently only parse out the temperature, and it appears we only
	  do that once when the network port is brought up.  More
	  functionality to be added later.

2002-10-08 22:52  we7u

	* src/: main.h, maps.c, maps.h, track_gui.c: Fixed bug where
	  TrackMe button didn't get disabled when tracking was cleared from
	  the menus.  Map indexing now removes indexes for deleted files.
	  Another ImageMagick API change is now handled in our code.

2002-10-08 21:32  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c: We now check for
	  modifier keys when the third mouse button press is detected and
	  dump out a warning message asking the user to turn off the
	  modifier keys.

2002-10-04 00:20  we7u

	* src/db.c: More correct parsing of Storm Data.

2002-10-03 17:31  we7u

	* src/db.c: Commenting out debug statements.

2002-10-03 17:29  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h: The start of decoding storm data.  More to do
	  in terms of units conversion and display, but the basic packet
	  decoding is coded and working.

2002-10-03 16:06  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added a comment.

2002-10-03 11:35  we7u

	* src/: maps.c, track_gui.c: Small tweaks to wget error messages.

2002-10-03 11:25  we7u

	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c, src/maps.c,
	  src/xa_config.c, src/xastir.h: Added a Disable Raster Map
	  togglebutton to the maps menu.  Added "Indexing" text to the
	  statusline as we're indexing maps.

2002-10-02 15:28  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changed auto_maps to use the in-memory map index.
	  Lot's of tweaks to sort the map index.  Now use the .geo
	  filenames instead of the http/ftp URL's.  Got rid of shx/dbf
	  filenames (using shp instead).  This got rid of the
	  triple-drawing of shapefiles that was ocurring with automaps.
	  Added statusline() calls to all of the draw functions.

2002-10-01 10:43  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added more error output for geoTIFF's, where proj may
	  not have been installed correctly.

2002-09-30 16:50  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Minor correction.  This window was WAY too
	  long when I defined 30 interfaces.  The new length is more
	  reasonable.

2002-09-30 16:06  we7u

	* src/: interface.h, interface_gui.c, main.c: Upp'ed the number of
	  interface to 15.  Tweaked the GUI and other portions of the code
	  to handle whatever MAX_IFACE_DEVICES is set to.  Xastir should
	  theoretically be able to handle any number of interfaces now, but
	  it's only been tested so far up to 15.

2002-09-30 00:19  we7u

	* README.1ST: Added a note about the 24kgrid file available from
	  gisdatadepot.

2002-09-29 23:41  we7u

	  datafiles.

2002-09-29 22:04  we7u

	* README.1ST: Added a few more sources of Shapefile maps.

2002-09-26 16:11  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fixes for Tigermap and GEO file segfaults.  Saw
	  segfaults with Tigermaps when "wget" returned a zero-length file.
	  These changes fix this problem.

2002-09-26 13:39  we7u

	* src/db.c: Limiting the new togglebutton to work only on objects
	  containing weather, not on all objects.

2002-09-26 13:29  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: A better logical relation between the
	  togglebuttons for the new "Display WX Object/Item" button.

	  objects.

2002-09-25 15:23  we7u

	* src/wx_gui.c: Widening some fields by one character width in Own
	  Weather Data dialog.

2002-09-25 15:13  we7u

	  Own Weather Station dialog and for Station Info dialog.

2002-09-25 00:49  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Added another
	  string for weather stuff.

2002-09-24 16:49  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Just adding some blank lines to delineate the
	  different functions.	More real code changes to come later.

2002-09-24 13:11  we7u

	* src/db.c: Better handling of weather stations and weather
	  objects.  We now try to parse the course/speed field _and_ the
	  'c' and 's' fields in all cases, and can handle some of the
	  different field positions that some of the RAWS weather objects
	  present to us.

2002-09-24 10:34  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changed wx_fuel_moisture so that a 00 reading equates
	  to 100%.

2002-09-23 23:48  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/db.h: Added parsing of
	  Fuel Temperature and Fuel Moisture for RAWS weather objects, and
	  the corresponding display in the Station Info dialog.

2002-09-23 22:53  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added some comments.

2002-09-23 11:46  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: _Very_ minor spelling fixes.

2002-09-23 11:40  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changes to the lat/long gridlines by Thierry Leconte:
	  "Now, the code draw solid line and 3 types of dashed lines.
	  Solid line is, as previously, for equator and Greenwich meridian.
	  The 3 dashed line corespond to locator coord scheme : 1st dasher
	  line for big square (2 first letters) 2nd dashed line for the 2
	  numbers 3rd dashed line for small square (2 last letter).
	  Depending of the zooming, the code could draw 1,2 or the 3 line
	  types."  We might wish to change the sizes of the boxes, but the
	  ideas behind it and the implementation are great!  Thanks
	  Thierry!

2002-09-23 11:29  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Updates for object persistance and a few
	  more on the new features list to be documented at some point. I
	  still exist. :-)

2002-09-23 10:38  we7u

	* src/: maps.c, util.c: Fixes by Tom Russo for map indexing of GNIS
	  files and for reading in zero-length files.  Thanks Tom!

2002-09-19 15:52  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changes by Thierry Leconte which make degrees/minutes
	  symbols appear in the status line, and add the Maidenhead grid
	  locator to it as well.  Small changes by we7u to tweak the widths
	  of the textfields on the status line.

2002-09-19 14:13  we7u

	* src/wx.c: More changes for Peet Bros. U2K weather station

	  variables once and for all.

2002-09-19 13:49  we7u

	* src/db.c: More careful string copying of callsigns in a couple of
	  places.  There was a possibility of overrunning the destination
	  string before.

2002-09-19 13:27  we7u

	* src/db.c: Adjusting buffer lengths to handle longer packets.

2002-09-19 12:28  we7u

	* src/: main.h, xastir.h: Change to allow u2k complete record mode
	  (long packets) to get through the decoding functions.

2002-09-19 12:16  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Another small tweak to rain totals for u2k.

2002-09-19 11:12  we7u

2002-09-19 09:32  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Commenting out the map index printf's in maps.c

2002-09-19 01:08  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding new language string for TrackMe button.

2002-09-19 01:03  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Added new language
	  string for TrackMe button.

2002-09-19 00:56  we7u

	* src/: main.c, track_gui.c, track_gui.h, xa_config.c: Implemented
	  new TrackMe button on the main window.  State is saved in config
	  file so that Xastir starts up in the correct mode.

2002-09-18 15:48  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, xa_config.c: Added more map types to the
	  VECTOR button on map chooser.  Now selects ".map", ".gnis",
	  ".pdb", and ".shp" files.  Changed default name of "winmaps.sys"
	  file to "selected_maps.sys".	This last change will only take
	  effect on new installations, or if the winmaps.sys file is
	  deleted.

2002-09-18 14:21  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c: Map indexing, saving/restoring from files.
	  This version is more space-efficient.  We could do more speedups
	  by doing a sort and binary search through the index, or using a
	  hash.

2002-09-18 12:35  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Small tweak to correct code which creates the empty
	  map index file.

2002-09-18 12:30  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Killing off the saving of the map index for now.
	  Plan on implementing a more space-efficient storage.

2002-09-18 12:17  we7u

	* src/: maps.h, main.c, maps.c: Now saving/restoring the map index
	  to a file.

2002-09-18 11:41  we7u

	* src/: main.c, main.h, maps.c, maps.h, xa_config.c: Initial
	  implementation of map indexing, still need to save/restore the
	  map index linked list to a file.  Currently the indexing occurs
	  _after_ the first map draw, then succeeding map draws check the
	  index which speeds things up considerably.  The plan is to write
	  the index to a file, read it in _before_ the first map draw, and
	  then re-index only when new files appear or files are changed in
	  the map directory.

2002-09-12 10:48  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added the Station Last Heard button into the
	  Sensitive enable/disable for Symbols in the menu.  It was getting
	  grey'ed out and not returning to the Sensitive state as the
	  Symbols Enable button was toggled.

2002-09-12 09:56  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fixes to draw_shapefile_map() to set a default line
	  width, for cases where specific maps are not recognized later in
	  the code.  The problem was that other areas in the drawing code
	  (probably tracklines) where causing map lines to get drawn in
	  double or triple width at times.

2002-09-10 16:35  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added a default line width setting to the start of
	  the polyline drawing portion of draw_shapefile_map().  This is an
	  attempt to get rid of the double line-widths that are sometimes
	  seen on the screen.

2002-09-10 16:14  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixing the new track detector for the save track
	  function.

2002-09-10 15:14  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h: A bit of housekeeping.  Renaming the TrackRow2
	  struct to TrackRow, since the old TrackRow is now deleted from
	  the code.

2002-09-10 12:22  we7u

	* src/: db.h, db.c: Fixes for station track storage.

2002-09-10 10:04  we7u

	* src/main.c: Creating the .xastir/tracklogs directory
	  automatically on startup.

2002-09-09 16:29  we7u

	  printf's under debug_level control.

2002-08-28 13:41  we7u

	* src/: db.c, util.c: Fix for bulletins popping up that are out of
	  range.  We were computing the distance from our station based on
	  the destination callsign (BLNx) instead of the originating
	  callsign.

2002-08-27 15:43  we7u

	* src/: util.h, util.c: Added higher precision timers in order to
	  time code sections.

2002-08-21 17:19  we7u

	* src/: bulletin_gui.c, bulletin_gui.h, db.c, main.c: Fixes for
	  bulletins popping up.  Now waits 15 seconds to see if a posit

	  filtering for characters output by an extract_multipoints debug
	  message.

2002-08-21 11:24  we7u

	* src/list_gui.c: Now grey out the object/item name as well if it

2002-08-21 11:16  we7u

	* src/list_gui.c: We now show deleted objects/items in the "View"
	  dialogs as ghosted.

2002-08-20 15:07  kd6zwr

	* src/main.c: Bumped up the test for debug level dialog.

	* FAQ: Minor addition to the "why can't I see stations" paragraph.

2002-08-15 16:57  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Moved the USGS Quad labels left by one square.  They
	  appear to be in the correct places now.

2002-08-15 14:27  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.paccomm: New startup file for Pac-Comm TNC's
	  with version 5.x firmware.

2002-08-15 10:22  we7u

	* scripts/coord-convert.pl: Added the capability to handle "48N
	  122W" and similar inputs.  Fixed a bug in DD MM.MM conversions.

2002-08-14 15:04  we7u

	* src/db.c: An attempt to prevent Emergency popups about the same
	  callsign from appearing more often than every 30 minutes.

2002-08-14 13:51  we7u

	* scripts/: coord-convert.pl, permutations.pl: Adding a blank line
	  between user input and output lines.

2002-08-14 11:21  we7u

	* scripts/permutations.pl: And handling yet another format...

2002-08-14 11:15  we7u

	* scripts/permutations.pl: Tweaks to more properly format some
	  inputs.

2002-08-14 10:55  we7u

	* src/db.c: Minor tweak to get rid of compiler warning.

2002-08-14 08:49  francais1

	* src/util.c: Nasty lat/lon to/from UTM conversion bug.  (Wasn't
	  referencing correct ellipsoid.) Also made last 2 characters of
	  grid square location lowercase since that seems more common.

2002-08-14 08:49  francais1

	* src/main.c: Nasty lat/lon to/from UTM conversion bug.  (Wasn't
	  referencing correct ellipsoid.)

2002-08-13 17:12  we7u

	* scripts/permutations.pl: New script which will show various
	  permutations for a lat/lon or UTM input.  Eventually plan to have
	  this script write a log file containing objects so that Xastir
	  can plot each of the positions.  This will be useful in quickly
	  determining which of the formats is within the area of interest.
	  Developed this for Search & Rescue applications.

2002-08-13 16:51  we7u

	* scripts/coord-convert.pl: Added a range check for the Easting
	  value.  Not exact, but better than nothing.

2002-08-13 15:34  we7u

	* scripts/coord-convert.pl: Added capability to use UTM as the
	  input coordinate.

2002-08-13 14:36  we7u

	* src/db.c: Commenting out debug statement.

2002-08-13 13:47  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixed Mic-E decoding problem having to do with position
	  ambiguity.  We have to specifically test for 'L' in the
	  destination field as it doesn't match the general bit patterns.
	  Stupid spec anyway.

2002-08-13 11:39  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, draw_symbols.c, draw_symbols.h: Severe storm
	  objects by Gerry Wheeler, KG4NBB.  Dale Huguley, KG5QD's weather
	  server (on the 'net) generates severe storm objects and
	  boundaries based on NWS data.  These objects are now decoded and
	  drawn by Gerry's new code additions.

2002-08-12 17:03  we7u

	* scripts/: Coordinate.pm, coord-convert.pl, test_coord.pl: Utility

2002-08-06 16:14  we7u

	* src/util.c: Getting rid of a message that appears if the

2002-08-06 13:42  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/main.c: Added a clear button for
	  the object/item history file.

2002-08-06 13:00  we7u

	* src/: main.c, util.c, util.h, xastir.h: Implementation of
	  persistent objects/items.  Each new, deleted, or moved
	  object/item is logged to "~/.xastir/config/object.log".  This
	  file is read in and each line processed on startup.  This will
	  also show tracklines for moved objects as each change is logged
	  to the file.

2002-08-06 11:33  we7u

	* src/db.c: Adding "AA:" to the beginning of auto-response
	  messages.

2002-08-06 09:52  francais1

	* src/maps.c: IsPseudoClass in ImageMagick 5.3.1 doesn't quite act
	  like I would have thought.  Changed to different check.

2002-08-05 15:29  we7u

	* src/: messages_gui.c, view_message_gui.c: More tweaks regarding
	  fonts.  Seems we can set foreground color but not background on a
	  couple of widgets.  Trying to set background color causes a
	  segfault.

2002-08-05 15:07  we7u

	* src/: messages_gui.c, view_message_gui.c: Move segfault fixes in
	  new code.

2002-08-05 15:05  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c: Fix for segfault in newly introduced
	  code.

2002-08-05 13:48  we7u

	* src/: bulletin_gui.c, draw_symbols.c, location_gui.c, main.c,
	  messages_gui.c, track_gui.c, view_message_gui.c, xastir.h: Added
	  defines for foreground and background font colors.  This and the
	  associated code changes should help to alleviate the problem
	  where font colors would accidentally change during runtime due to
	  color-ls being run in the starting Xterm.

2002-07-26 09:35  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Very minor changes to the new scripts
	  section.

2002-07-26 09:30  we7u

2002-07-26 08:45  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Added scripts section, minor update to new
	  features list.

2002-07-25 22:24  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Commenting out some debug messages.

2002-07-25 20:29  we7u

	* src/: db.c, igate.c, igate.h, main.c: Implemented SENT and HEARD
	  queues for igating->RF.  Dupes are now eliminated.  This includes
	  if another igate beat us to getting a packet on RF:  In that case
	  we don't add to the traffic on RF by sending it out too.

2002-07-24 12:58  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fix for igating:  We were testing the ST_VIATNC flag
	  for a station first to see if it had been heard via a TNC
	  interface.  This flag gets reset if the last 20 packets were
	  heard from non-TNC interfaces.  We now check the
	  heard_via_tnc_last_time timestamp to see if it's nonzero.  This
	  timestamp does _not_ get set to 0.  The code in
	  heard_via_tnc_in_past_hour() should work better for igating now.

2002-07-23 15:04  we7u

	* src/: interface_gui.c, xa_config.c: Changing txtail default value
	  to from 10ms to 30ms.  Should be proper for 1200 baud.

2002-07-23 14:37  we7u

	* README.1ST: Added Lindows to the list.

2002-07-23 14:27  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, interface.h, interface_gui.c, xa_config.c:
	  Turned "Full Duplex" KISS parameter into a togglebutton.

2002-07-23 13:43  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, interface.h, interface_gui.c, xa_config.c:
	  Added TxTail parameter to the KISS properties dialog.

2002-07-23 13:07  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Putting more debug messages under debug_level
	  control.

2002-07-22 19:41  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Added mention of RELAY digipeating and
	  fixed a formatting thing.

2002-07-22 11:08  we7u

	* configure, configure.in: Bumping it to version 1.1.3.  Getting
	  ready for another development release.

2002-07-22 10:41  we7u

	* src/: db.c, interface_gui.c: Commenting out debug message.
	  Making Relay Digipeat togglebuttons insensitive until the code to
	  implement them is functional.

2002-07-20 00:44  we7u

	* src/db.c: Don't relay from KISS interface if transmit for that
	  interface is turned off.

2002-07-20 00:31  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Changes to make RELAY digipeat insensitive
	  when transmit is disabled for that interface.

2002-07-19 23:50  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Commenting out another debug statement.

2002-07-19 23:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Fixes to AX.25 interfaces that were broken
	  earlier by KISS TNC changes.

2002-07-19 17:02  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changes to serial lockfiles.  Now closes port
	  before removing lock.  Attempts to close port and remove lock if
	  open fails for any number of reasons.

2002-07-19 15:19  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Fixes for errant long packets.  Code had the
	  wrong number for the length of the incoming strings.

2002-07-19 13:51  we7u

	* src/: db.c, interface.c: Found an off-by-one error in
	  incoming_data_length.  Changed a lot of comments w.r.t. KISS
	  interfaces.

2002-07-19 01:06  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, interface.c, interface.h, main.c: More work on
	  RELAY digipeating for Serial KISS TNC interfaces.  Getting
	  closer, but this version is still non-functional.

2002-07-18 17:02  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, main.c: More preparation for later coding of
	  the RELAY digipeat function.	Not implemented yet.

2002-07-18 16:49  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: More comments.

2002-07-18 16:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Fixing another double-lock problem.

2002-07-18 16:36  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added an important comment.

2002-07-18 16:34  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Fixing a double-lock problem that I introduced
	  earlier today.

2002-07-18 14:55  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Adding a debug_level statement in that was
	  missing.

2002-07-18 14:47  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Adding relay_digipeat stuff to the AX.25
	  interface GUI.

2002-07-18 14:40  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/interface.h,
	  src/interface_gui.c, src/xa_config.c: Preliminary code including
	  GUI support for RELAY digipeating on Serial KISS TNC interfaces.
	  The back-end code is not implemented yet, so right now it looks
	  pretty but doesn't do anything.  The plan is to add similar
	  support for AX.25 kernel interfaces.	Regular serial TNC
	  interfaces and NET interfaces don't need this capability.  For
	  regular serial TNC's RELAY digipeating is turned on/off in the
	  config file for that interface.

2002-07-18 13:01  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Removed the serial port settings from the
	  Serial KISS TNC descriptions.  The port is set to 8N1 by default
	  now and cannot be changed.

2002-07-18 12:59  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Changed interface properties dialog when
	  dealing with Serial KISS TNC interfaces:  No longer is the user
	  presented with serial parameter choices which are not allowed to
	  be changed anyway.

2002-07-18 12:39  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Changed KISS interface description to
	  agree with the code, which forces the N81 option for serial port
	  parameters now.

2002-07-18 12:37  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Forcing KISS interfaces to N81 for the
	  serial port parameters.

2002-07-18 12:17  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Just spelling fixes.

2002-07-18 12:14  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: A few minor additions/corrections to the
	  KISS, TNC, and AX.25 interface descriptions.

2002-07-18 12:04  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added some locks where a few were missing.
	  Added code to send the KISS parameters down to the TNC when the
	  port is first opened.

2002-07-18 10:45  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Updates for serial KISS TNC, message
	  paths, igate paths, and more..

2002-07-18 09:31  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, interface.c, interface.h, interface_gui.c,
	  main.c, messages_gui.c: Reorganized KISS parameter widgets in the
	  dialog.  Changed to string,length instead of relying on the
	  terminating zero in the string for transmitting strings.  This is
	  due to the fact that KISS packets can have 0x00 in them as data.
	  Fixed the problems with non-posit packet transmission and the
	  Serial KISS TNC interface.

2002-07-17 18:01  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, interface.h, interface_gui.c, xa_config.c:
	  Added kiss parameters to the properties dialog.

2002-07-17 16:17  we7u

	* src/main.c: Better behaved positioning of dialogs.  They won't
	  get positioned quite as far down the screen now.

2002-07-17 16:06  we7u

	* src/igate.c: Reformatted all of the igating routines.  Added a
	  specific check so that we don't re-inject TCPIP or TCPXX packets
	  back into the internet (we don't want looping).  The routines are
	  much more understandable now and should be easier to maintain.

2002-07-17 13:54  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Changed/added comments.  Deleted the section of
	  code in port_read() that looked for AX.25 flag characters, as
	  KISS packets should not normally contain them.  We instead will
	  try breaking apart the KISS packets based on \n and \r
	  characters.

2002-07-17 13:05  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h: Changing to unsigned char for one parameter so
	  that we can check all eight bits of each char.

2002-07-17 13:01  we7u

	* src/db.c: Lots of comment changes.  Added check code to the
	  decoding functions to look for and correct concatenated KISS
	  packets.  Currently the tacked-on packets will get deleted.  This
	  should get fixed in later revisions.

2002-07-17 12:25  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Reformatted, changed/added comments.  No code
	  changes.

2002-07-17 02:04  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Initial code to implement Serial KISS TNC
	  transmit.

2002-07-16 17:00  we7u

	* src/interface.c: More preparation for doing KISS TNC transmit.
	  Not finished yet.

2002-07-16 15:33  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Tweak to check for NULL in igate_path.  Lot's of
	  comment changes.

2002-07-16 14:32  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/interface_gui.c: Fixed language
	  string for KISS TNC dialog.  Added comments.

2002-07-16 14:09  we7u

	* src/interface.c: A few more small tweaks to help with closing
	  Serial KISS TNC interfaces.

2002-07-16 11:26  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added some comments.

2002-07-16 09:47  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, interface.c, interface_gui.c, main.c: Initial
	  implementation of Serial KISS TNC support.  This one is
	  receive-only.  Still have to write the code to generate the
	  outgoing AX.25 header for transmitting.  This one may be unstable
	  yet, but the instability should only affect Xastir instances with
	  this port enabled.

2002-07-15 16:25  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Commented out some debugging code.

2002-07-15 16:24  we7u

	* src/: igate.c, interface.h, interface_gui.c, xa_config.c, main.c,
	  interface.c: The start of code to implement serial port KISS tnc
	  functionality (without using kernel-mode AX.25 ports).  Not
	  functional yet.

2002-07-15 16:03  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,
	  language-Portuguese.sys, language-Spanish.sys: Just starting to
	  add Serial KISS TNC capability.  Not functional yet.

2002-07-15 01:02  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Fixed one problem with igate_path.  Added a
	  bunch of comments, reformatted some code, changed some variable
	  names.

2002-07-13 10:38  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/igate.c,
	  src/interface.c, src/interface.h, src/main.c, src/messages.c,
	  src/messages.h, src/messages_gui.c, src/wx.c, src/xastir.h:
	  Implemented reverse path for messaging.  Xastir now tries to
	  figure out a reasonable return path when doing messaging.

2002-07-12 16:59  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Adding some code in preparation for setting
	  up individual return paths for messaging.  This code figures out
	  the return path from the last path received for that station,
	  including dropping "RELAY" callsigns and asterisks and converting
	  WIDEn-N callsigns to their original glory.  Converts TRACE and
	  TRACEn-N callsigns to WIDE and WIDEn-N as well.

2002-07-12 14:09  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/igate.c,
	  src/interface.c, src/interface.h, src/interface_gui.c,
	  src/main.c, src/messages.c, src/wx.c, src/xa_config.c:
	  Implemented separate unproto path for igating.  Change it via the
	  properties dialog for affected interfaces.  If nothing entered,
	  it will round-robin between the other three interfaces or select
	  a default path.

2002-07-12 12:15  we7u

	* src/db.c: Now have red circle around tracked station.

2002-07-12 11:08  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Added Maidenhead Grid Locator output to the
	  Coordinate Calculator.

2002-07-12 09:52  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added mnemonics keys to the right mouse button menu.
	  Now if you select it via the Maps menu you can still navigate
	  through it via keyboard.  Note that some of the options won't
	  work properly without a mouse pointer pointing to an object on
	  the screen, like Station Info.  For those options needing to snag
	  the mouse pointer, it appears to use whatever point the mouse
	  pointer is on (as usual).  If the pointer is outside the drawing
	  area, all bets are off.

2002-07-11 17:20  we7u

	* src/db.c: Proper rounding of course when saving track data.

2002-07-11 16:54  we7u

	* src/db.c: Tweaking altitude/speed/course displays to skip over
	  the first trackpoint, which is the same as our current data.	We
	  now look at the next oldest trackpoint to try to pull out
	  slightly older data for display purposes.

2002-07-11 16:31  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: A few changes to the SmartBeaconing
	  parameter descriptions.

2002-07-11 16:22  we7u

	* src/db.c: Decoupling speed/course from each other for display
	  purposes.

2002-07-11 16:10  we7u

	* src/util.c: Reducing PHG circles by 1/2, per Bob Bruninga's
	  recommendations.

2002-07-11 15:46  we7u

	* src/db.c: Skipping first tracklog entry when filling in the
	  Station Info dialog.	It's the same as the first line or "Last
	  Position".

2002-07-11 15:07  we7u

	* src/util.c: Small change to valid_path() to allow "qAC" and
	  similar q-codes to pass through.  This is a new addition from
	  Dale Heatherington to the aprsd server for anti-looping purposes.

2002-07-11 14:45  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changed minimum length check for GGA/RMC strings and
	  put one debug message inside debug_level logic.

2002-07-11 14:36  we7u

	* src/db.c: More general code for parsing RMC and GGA sentences.
	  Now allows any number of digits after the decimal point for the
	  lat/long fields.

2002-07-11 12:51  we7u

	* src/db.c: Tweak to make bad Mic-E positions not draw tracks.

2002-07-11 09:03  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Updates to new features list, added
	  smartbeaconing help, other minor stuff.

2002-07-09 15:38  we7u

	* src/db.c: Expire code for trackpoints.  Currently uses the
	  station expire variable for choosing when to expire each
	  trackpoint.  Called from draw_trail() for each station.

2002-07-09 14:12  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Now outputs warning messages for Shapefile maps that
	  have bad lat/lon values.  This lets the user know which map files
	  or which shapes within the file have problems.

2002-07-09 13:00  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Searching for excessively long packets earlier
	  in the process.  Now we drop them on the floor before the decode
	  routines.

2002-07-09 11:12  we7u

	* src/db.c: Tweaked a debug line to output more data.

2002-07-09 10:55  we7u

	* src/: db.c, gps.c, interface.c, interface.h, main.c, util.c,
	  wx.c: String lengths can be MAX_DEVICE_BUFFER length, currently
	  defined to be 4096 characters, when going into the decode
	  routines.  These are fixes to handle these long line lengths in a
	  graceful manner.

2002-07-08 20:17  rzg

	* src/db.c: Moving a newline in debugging code so it won't get
	  lost.

2002-07-08 18:02  kd6zwr

	* src/maps.c: One more GNIS icon - parks.

2002-07-08 15:43  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, db.c, draw_symbols.c, interface.c, main.c, maps.c,
	  messages.c, view_message_gui.c: Changing a bunch of comments.
	  Mostly removing "we7u" bookmarks.

2002-07-07 18:30  rzg

	* README.1ST: Weather shapefiles are moving...

2002-07-04 11:26  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, list_gui.c: Changes which implement
	  dynamically-allocated tracklogs.  Expiration and function which
	  writes track to file need to be worked on yet.

2002-07-03 23:28  we7u

	* src/db.c: Slight reformatting and added a few comments.  No real
	  code changes.

2002-07-03 17:03  we7u

	* src/db.c: Commenting out some debug statements.

2002-07-03 16:59  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added a few comments.

2002-07-03 16:46  we7u

	* src/db.c: Found that the first trackpoint was getting skipped
	  when displaying in Station Info dialog.  Fixed it.  We also now
	  look in the first tracklog point for course/speed/altitude if any
	  of these parameters are missing in the current data.	Found other
	  problems in tracklog indexing in db.c that need to be fixed yet.

2002-07-03 12:16  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,

	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/main.c, src/main.h,
	  src/maps.c, src/xa_config.c: Added a new togglebutton that
	  enables bulletin popup for new bulletins.  Moved the smartbeacon
	  enable button to its dialog.

2002-07-03 11:22  we7u

	* src/db.c: Reverting back to old Bulletin method for now.  New
	  method doesn't work right if bulletin received w/no posit, then
	  posit is received later.

2002-07-03 11:14  we7u

	* README.1ST: Added a blurb about LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable being
	  ignored when running Xastir as SUID root.

2002-07-03 11:10  we7u

	* src/: bulletin_gui.c, db.c: Fixed bulletins so that they don't
	  pop up if distance is zero, unless the range setting is set to
	  zero.  It was getting much too annoying the other way when
	  connected to a cached network feed.  With the new code these
	  things will cause bulletins to pop up:   Distance non-zero and
	  within range setting.    Range setting set to zero.  The user can
	  also bring up the View->Bulletins dialog and it will still show
	  the zero-range bulletins in any case.

2002-07-03 09:09  francais1

	* src/maps.c: Applied, slightly tweaked and tested patch from
	  Derrick Brashear which adds support for different PHOTOMETRIC
	  geotiffs.

2002-07-02 16:25  we7u

	* src/: db.c, util.c, util.h: Added Maidenhead grid locators to
	  Station Info dialog.	Code by dl9sau which was derived from
	  Wampes util/qth.c code by dk5sg.

2002-07-02 14:31  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added more detailed debug messages for the case where
	  lat/lon to be converted is outside the proper ranges.

2002-07-02 14:30  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Quieting some debug messages having to do with
	  compressed weather alerts (which aren't implemented yet).

2002-07-02 12:40  we7u

	* src/main.c: Tweaked TigerMap config dialog so that strings in
	  different languages would cause a resize of the dialog, and the
	  dialog would be smaller/easier to use with smaller screen
	  resolutions.

2002-07-02 11:10  n0vh

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, xa_config.c, xastir.h: Added code to allow

	  storage and display of comments/status.

2002-06-28 11:18  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added an 'X' symbol and a nicely-drawn label for
	  waypoing shapefiles.

2002-06-28 10:47  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changes to make waypoint Shapefiles appear properly
	  in Xastir.

	  items and reformatted them.

2002-06-27 13:12  we7u

	* README.1ST: Added notes regarding ld.so.cache to the Shapelib
	  section.

2002-06-26 10:34  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fix for missing IMAGESIZE tag in .geo file:  We
	  output an error message and skip loading that file.  Someday we
	  may wish to try to find out the imagesize via calls to the
	  imagemagick or xpm libraries.

2002-06-26 09:46  we7u

	* src/db.c: Bulletins no longer cause a refresh of the Send Message
	  dialogs.

2002-06-26 08:50  francais1

	* src/: list_gui.c, list_gui.h, xa_config.c: Added a number of
	  lists definition to the end of the list number definitions so
	  that the code doesn't need touching every time you add a new
	  list.  Moved list number definitions to list_gui.h so that I can
	  see them from xa_config.c.

2002-06-25 17:20  we7u

	* src/db.h: Added a line for is_my_call().

2002-06-25 17:13  we7u

	* src/: list_gui.c, main.c, xa_config.c: New list for viewing
	  objects/items that we own.

	* help/help-English.dat: Spelling.

2002-06-25 16:28  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat: Updated helpfile for recent changes.

2002-06-25 15:03  we7u

	* src/: bulletin_gui.c, bulletin_gui.h, db.c: Fixes for annoying
	  bulletins.  It should only pop up the bulletin dialog now when
	  new bulletins come in that are within range.	It's possible to
	  receive a bulletin without having a posit from that station, then
	  get a posit, making it outside the range.  In this case you may
	  get a popup without knowing why.  It's better than what it was
	  doing before though.

2002-06-25 12:41  we7u

	* src/: list_gui.c, main.c, xa_config.c: Added "View->Objects &
	  Items" list.

2002-06-25 12:33  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-English.sys,
	  language-French.sys, language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys,

	  new View->Objects & Items dialog.

2002-06-24 15:40  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Changed DF beam-heading objects to draw in
	  red3.  Using stippling the lines were not visible on some map
	  backgrounds.	Also narrowed the lines for pod_circles (not fully
	  implemented yet).

2002-06-24 12:28  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added comments.  No code changes.

2002-06-24 12:27  we7u

2002-06-21 20:28  n0vh

	* src/maps.c: Commented all the findu code out from maps.c since
	  it's now done from track_gui.c.  It will be removed in the
	  future.

2002-06-21 14:20  we7u

	* src/: draw_symbols.c, draw_symbols.h: Added draw_pod_circle()

2002-06-21 12:36  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added some comments.

2002-06-21 12:36  we7u

2002-06-21 07:02  we7u

	* src/main.c: Initial GUI for setting SmartBeaconing parameters.

2002-06-20 15:41  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adding bearing degrees to the Measure function.

2002-06-20 15:23  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c: We now create the View->Bulletins dialog when
	  bulletins come in.

2002-06-20 14:01  we7u

	* src/: igate.c, interface.c, messages.c: Added/modified some

	  waypoints.

2002-06-19 17:17  we7u

	* src/: db.c, gps.c, gps.h, interface.c, interface.h: For those of
	  you with Garmin GPS units:  Set up the audio proximity alarm
	  range for some distance around your station and Xastir will now
	  create waypoints for each APRS station/object/item that it hears
	  within that range.  They'll appear on your Garmin map display as
	  waypoints.  Enjoy! You can delete the waypoints by type.  They
	  appear as the circle with the 'X' in the middle.  You may want to
	  change other waypoints to some other type before you play with
	  this new Xastir feature.

2002-06-19 10:53  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixed remove_leading_spaces() as it didn't work at all
	  as coded.  It liked to truncate after the first word.  Also fixed
	  some malloc sizes added recently.

2002-06-19 10:44  francais1

	* src/db.c: strlen, not sizeof

2002-06-18 17:06  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, list_gui.c: Additional memory savings for the
	  node_path variable in the station database.  Changed it to a
	  pointer and allocate exact space for the string when stored or
	  updated.

2002-06-18 16:19  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, list_gui.c, main.c: More space savings.  Turned
	  comment into a pointer in the station record and allocate just
	  the space we need for it.

2002-06-18 15:21  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, list_gui.c, main.c: Changed to
	  dynamically-allocated linked list of comment strings in the
	  station database.  This results in memory savings due to no empty
	  strings being stored for stations without comment fields.  It
	  also shows all status and comment strings that have been seen for
	  each station now in the Station Info dialog.	We'll have loads of
	  fun tracking MIC-E expansion on the internet servers now!

2002-06-18 11:55  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Simplifying the logic a bit.  Same general

	  other comments.

2002-06-17 14:40  we7u

	* src/db.c: More comments.  Another tweak to SmartBeaconing:  If
	  we've sped up a bit the code will now bring the next beacon in
	  closer (in time), instead of waiting for the next slow beacon to
	  reset to the slower interval.

2002-06-17 14:16  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added a few SmartBeaconing comments.

2002-06-17 13:11  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Another few SmartBeaconing tweaks.  Setting
	  defaults for variables to prevent multiple beacons as we get
	  started.

2002-06-17 12:19  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: A few SmartBeaconing tweaks.  Commented out
	  the experimental SmartBeaconing tweaks that caused a beacon when
	  entering/exiting stop mode.  Changed how other SmartBeaconing
	  math was done.

2002-06-17 11:42  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Added color-coding for time-since-last-heard
	  display.  Green for 0-29 mins, Yellow for 30-59 minutes, Red for
	  60 mins to infinity.	This is to help keep track of which
	  stations are active and which haven't been heard for a while.

2002-06-17 10:16  we7u

	* src/db.c: Moved the "reversed symbol" message into a debug level.

2002-06-14 17:19  we7u

2002-06-14 14:15  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c, main.h: The beginnings of SmartBeaconing
	  support.  The working code is in there but the GUI interface is
	  not coded yet.

2002-06-14 10:58  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Changed "time since last report" display to

2002-06-13 12:22  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixes which check for locally controlled object/item
	  which has moved.  If it has, update the time-sorting of the
	  record and update the timestamp in the station record.  This
	  should fix the problem where an expired object, when moved, stays
	  ghosted.

2002-06-13 11:47  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c: Making Send Message dialog wide enough so
	  that spec-compliant-length messages won't wrap to a new line.

2002-06-13 11:21  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, maps.c: Converting a few more snprintf's to

	  togglebutton to the Configure->Defaults dialog.

2002-06-10 15:02  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixes to give increased resolution for lat/lon when
	  using compressed packets for objects/items.

2002-06-10 14:43  we7u

	* src/: db.c, util.c: Fixed compressed positions so that we can
	  take advantage of the higher resolution.

2002-06-08 12:05  n0vh

	* src/xa_config.c: Added some missing #ifdef statements for
	  tigermap data in the config file

2002-06-07 18:34  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Initial support for transmitting
	  objects/items with compressed positions.  They're not displaying
	  in the proper positions on the map yet though.

2002-06-07 13:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added debugging into to interface.c.  Changed
	  the way that we run through all interfaces when transmitting.

2002-06-07 13:42  we7u

	* src/util.c: Added support for lat/lon string conversions where we
	  have more digits after the decimal point.

2002-06-07 11:10  we7u

	* src/: db.c, xastir.h: Bring up Locate Station window if an
	  Emergency message is received.  The operator has a choice whether
	  to center on the station or just dismiss the dialog.

2002-06-07 09:48  n0vh

	* src/main.c: Load Tigermaps prior to disk maps so disk maps can be
	  overlayed if desired.

2002-06-07 08:52  n0vh

	* src/main.c: Disable all maps now also functions with new
	  TigerMaps routines.

2002-06-06 18:40  n0vh

	* src/maps.c: More code cleanup in the tigermap section.  Still
	  some optimizations to go.

2002-06-06 18:12  n0vh

	* src/xa_config.c: Updated to save the tiger_flag and
	  tigermap_intensity in the users config file.

2002-06-06 17:02  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added a popup dialog for MIC-E emergency messages.
	  Displays the callsign of the station in trouble.

2002-06-06 15:03  we7u

	* src/: messages.c, xa_config.c: Moved range checking for
	  message_counter to xa_config.  More efficient.  Only needs to be
	  done once when starting up.

2002-06-06 14:45  we7u

	* src/: messages.c, xa_config.c, xastir.h: Converted
	  message_counter to a string.	Changed message sequence numbers to
	  be 2 characters within this range: 0-9A-Za-z.  This prevents
	  lockups when messaging with APRS+ stations.

2002-06-06 14:43  we7u

	* src/db.c: Removed old code.

2002-06-06 11:00  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Portuguese.sys,
	  config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/main.c, src/xastir.h:
	  Implemented satellite ack mode, where the Reply/Ack protocol is
	  used to send ack's through satellites, and ack's like "ack001"
	  are disabled entirely.

2002-06-06 10:03  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, messages.c: Changes which implement full
	  Reply/Ack protocol.  This should speed up messaging dramatically
	  when involved in live QSO's with the APRS programs that support
	  this protocol.  This lists currently includes aprsDOS, APRS+, and
	  Xastir.

2002-06-05 13:28  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, messages.c: Marking timed-out messages in Send
	  Message dialog properly.  Small changes to Reply/Ack sequence
	  numbers.

2002-06-04 16:13  we7u

	* src/: messages.c, xa_config.c: Switching to base-90 for message
	  sequence numbers (all the way to lower-case 'z').  Also tweaked
	  xa_config.c to help us avoid the message_counter rollover
	  problem.

2002-06-04 15:47  we7u

	* src/messages.c: Changed from base-91 to base-89 format for
	  message sequence numbers.  This is to avoid use of the '{'
	  character within the sequence.

2002-06-04 15:25  we7u

	* src/messages.c: Converted outgoing sequence numbers to
	  2-character base-91 encoding.  Added a trailing '}' character to
	  signify that we're Reply-Ack protocol capable.

2002-06-04 14:32  we7u

	* src/messages.c: Had to take out the '}' from the sequence number
	  as it messed things up.

2002-06-04 14:20  we7u

	* src/: db.c, messages.c: Message sequence numbers are saved
	  through restarts now.  Added more comments.

2002-06-04 13:27  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changed several comments.  Decoding of Reply/Ack
	  protocol (free-ride ACK's) is now tested and working.  This
	  really speeds up live messaging.  When encoding of the free-ride
	  ACK's is implemented as well it'll speed up messaging even more.

2002-06-03 17:50  rzg

	* README.1ST, help/help-English.dat: Updates for tigermap changes
	  and minor bits I missed in the previous update.

	  not being setup since there is no .geo file.	Fixed
	  draw_tiger_map intensity/levels bug.

2002-06-03 09:21  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing some line widths and colors back to what we
	  had before the weekend.  We're not trying to duplicate the
	  TigerMap servers colors or look-and-feel.  We need more subdued
	  colors so that symbols and tracks show up better on top of the
	  maps.  The line widths are necessary in order to more quickly
	  identify major roads without having to rely only on color.

2002-06-03 08:38  we7u

	  subroutine.  This should probably be done with some of the other
	  items in draw_geo_image_map as well.	N0VH

2002-06-02 14:54  n0vh

	* config/language-Dutch.sys: Made more updates to support tigermap

	  not UI-View messaging.

2002-05-31 14:24  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixes for last_ack timer.  We now refuse to send ack's

	  multiple interfaces are sending us copies of the same message.

2002-05-31 12:36  we7u

	  successful.

2002-05-24 15:01  we7u

	* src/: db.c, util.c: Fixed spelling error in util.c.  Fixes for
	  incorrect sorting in Send Message window for the case where the
	  remote client has restarted and is re-using sequence numbers:
	  Xastir will now replace the older messages in the database and
	  update the timestamp, which keeps the proper ordering for a QSO.
	  Messages older than 8 hours with the same text will also get
	  replaced and get a new timestamp.

	* src/: view_message_gui.c, xa_config.c: We now dump all currently
	  active messages out to the view->messages window when it's first
	  opened.  Different format, but still useful.	The format is
	  easily tweaked later.  Also changed the default
	  VIEW_MESSAGE_LIMIT to 10000.	This can be tweaked by the user in
	  the ~/.xastir/xastir.cnf file.  Max allowed by the code is now
	  99999.

	  If found, fill in with current time and print out a warning.

2002-05-17 14:14  we7u

	* src/db.c: Only cause a Send Message dialog update on the first
	  ack.	Subsequent ack's cause no update.

2002-05-17 11:37  we7u

	* src/db.c: Update message windows only when the first message or
	  the first ack comes in, or when the message doesn't match the
	  same sequence number message already stored.	This helps to
	  reduce flashing of the messages windows due to multiple copies of
	  ack's/messages being received.

2002-05-17 00:01  we7u

	* src/db.c: Changes to eliminate dupes in Send Message dialog.

	  systems.

2002-05-14 20:26  rzg

2002-05-09 15:29  francais1

	* src/: color.c, color.h, main.c, maps.c, maps.h, xa_config.c: Sped
	  up drawing of DirectColor images on a DirectColor screen.  It was
	  very slow because it called XAllocColor for every pixel in a
	  jpeg.  It now uses saved information on the default display
	  visual to pack the RGB into the correct bits for the pixel.  I
	  did this because I was finding some nasty color effects with the
	  image intensity settings.  I decided to leave image intensity
	  around for geotiffs, but now use gamma correction from
	  Imagemagick for all other image formats that go through
	  imagemagick.	There can now be a gamma setting in each .geo file
	  and there is an overall adjustment which will subtract or add to
	  the individual image gamma.  While I was at it, I enabled the
	  ability to specify several of the imagemagick enhancement
	  functions in .geo files.

2002-05-09 14:31  we7u

	  popup window.

2002-04-30 15:53  we7u

	* src/: main.c, xa_config.c, xa_config.h: get_int() and get_long()
	  now check for min/max values, and assign a default value if the
	  number is outside this range.  Also prints a warning message if
	  it has to assign the default.

2002-04-30 13:50  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Changing the levels at which smaller roads and labels
	  for those roads get drawn.  All roads are drawn at zoom 64 and
	  lower.  Labels for small roads start showing up at zoom 16 and
	  lower.

2002-04-30 11:57  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Converting back to "convert" without path until we
	  get configure support for figuring out the path.

2002-04-30 11:31  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Adding another path to convert.

2002-04-30 11:30  we7u

2002-04-27 16:03  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Created linked list for Shapelib labels already

	  for enabling/disabling the "Transmit Raw WX data" togglebutton.
	  The #define enabling this button is commented out.  Most likely
	  the only people interested in this button would be people
	  debugging code for certain Peet Bros. weather stations where the
	  raw data from them is allowed over the air by the APRS spec.

2002-04-26 08:53  francais1

	  mapshots.com county maps made from tiger data.

2002-04-25 10:52  we7u

2002-04-24 16:00  we7u

	* src/: maps.c, maps.h: Fix for segfaults in Shapefiles.

2002-04-24 15:23  francais1

	  Tweaked river drawing slightly.

2002-04-24 15:09  francais1

	* src/maps.c: Made gnis map files draw regardless of the labels
	  setting since a gnis map is all labels, so if you picked it, you
	  want it drawn, period.

2002-04-24 14:23  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Adding missing free() calls in draw_shapefile_map().

2002-04-24 13:06  we7u

2002-04-24 11:28  francais1

	* src/maps.c: IMHO, I've improved the guessing of what shapefile we
	  are dealing with and also the drawing colors and style...

2002-04-24 11:24  francais1

	* src/: draw_symbols.c, main.c, xastir.h: Changed name of
	  pixmap_stipple to pixmap_2x2_stipple and made it load from an xbm

2002-04-24 11:23  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Minor change to get rid of compiler warning.  Changed
	  static variable to non-static.

	  so that it can be the ocean)

2002-04-24 09:58  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Commented out annoying debug statements that get
	  in the way each time.

2002-04-24 09:54  we7u

	* src/: alert.h, maps.c: Speedups for weather alerts.  Once we know
	  what the bounding rectangle is for an alert, we stuff it into the
	  alert struct.  load_alert_maps() then uses that info to determine
	  whether a shape is within the viewport, without having to snag
	  that info from the Shapefile each time.

2002-04-24 09:20  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Removed old code.  Put in warning printf for old
	  weather alert stuff in routine that doesn't handle it anymore.

	  line when a grid is asked for.  Teasing for utm grid drawing.

2002-04-24 01:06  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h, maps.c: Added "index" field to alert
	  records, initially set to -1.  This gets filled in with the index
	  into the Shapefile when the shape is searched for.  This
	  dramatically speeds up drawing of weather alerts 'cuz the search
	  is skipped on the 2nd and later uses of the alert.

2002-04-23 23:03  francais1

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, xastir.h: Initial support for using
	  stipples for weather alerts with a description of the alert
	  event.

2002-04-23 22:57  francais1

	* symbols/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in, alert.xbm, flood.xbm,
	  snow.xbm, tornado.xbm, wind.xbm, winter_wx.xbm, wntr_strm.xbm:

	* src/wx_gui.c: Added the capability to finger the weather server
	  by double-clicking on a weather alert line in the View->Weather
	  Alerts dialog.  The output currently appears in the xterm that
	  you start Xastir from.

2002-04-22 23:14  we7u

	* src/wx_gui.c: Changed View->Weather Alerts dialog to
	  single-select mode.  Added a callback and callback function for
	  the double-click operation.

2002-04-22 22:46  we7u

	* src/wx_gui.c: Changed View->Weather Alerts dialog so that it can
	  be resized.

2002-04-22 22:16  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h, db.c, wx_gui.c: Decoded SKY alerts.  They
	  now get associated with the proper weather alert packets.
	  Tweaked View->Weather Alerts dialog to display them properly and
	  added a horizontal scrollbar to that dialog.

2002-04-22 17:03  rzg

	* FAQ:

	  regard to the weather alert changeover to shapefile format.

2002-04-22 14:08  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Fix to weather alerts.  Expired alerts will now be
	  removed from the View->Weather Alert dialog after they've been
	  expired more than one hour.

2002-04-22 09:57  we7u

	* src/alert.c: The start of adding "CIVIL" as another weather
	  alert.  Not completely functional yet.  Also added more of Dale
	  Hugueley's comments.

	  where objects after a space were being parsed as new alerts.

2002-04-17 12:58  we7u

	* src/: alert.c, alert.h, db.c, wx_gui.c: Changing View->Weather

	  particular alert.

2002-04-17 11:36  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fix for weather alerts disappearing at different zoom
	  levels or while panning around.  The problem had to do with the
	  alert getting marked as being outside the viewport, then they
	  wouldn't be looked at again.

2002-04-16 18:02  we7u

	* src/maps.c: closedir() to go with the opendir().  ;-)

2002-04-16 16:17  we7u

	  have to change any configuration or code in order to use the new
	  files.

2002-04-15 20:30  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Initial decoding for the different types of weather

	  user changes it in the default menu.

2002-04-05 14:50  we7u

	* src/: main.c, main.h, maps.c: Modifying zooming in with the mouse
	  such that it now figures out whether most of the mouse movement
	  was in the horizontal or in the vertical direction, then computes

	  src/interface.h, src/interface_gui.c, src/xa_config.c: Added
	  KD6VPE's changes to add tenth/hundredth rain gauge types to the
	  weather interfaces.  This is to support the two types of rain
	  gauges for Peet Brothers weather stations.  This patch implements
	  a global variable and the interface widgets needed to manipulate
	  it, but does _not_ implement the code to do anything with the
	  variable yet.

2002-03-30 10:00  we7u

2002-03-28 21:53  francais1

	* src/alert.c: There were several strncpy's without a following
	  str[last] = `\0` statement.  One of them caused a segfault.  This
	  whole file probably needs looking over for such problems.  I
	  fixed a few I thought need the statement or in the case of some
	  memmove's, seemed wrong to me.

2002-03-28 16:19  we7u

	* src/: lang.c, main.c: Fixed langcode segfault.  Fixed a
	  lang_hotkey that was wrong.

2002-03-28 10:27  francais1

	* src/main.c: Commented out code that clears mouse pointer location
	  status line when we leave Xastir window because I believe we may
	  be trying to write down that information in another window or
	  some such action.

2002-03-27 16:54  francais1

	* src/: db.c, main.c, util.c, xastir.h: Added and enabled DDMMSS

	  there.

2002-03-27 10:21  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixed a problem caused by the mass update to new debug
	  levels:  The station callsign was truncated in Station Info
	  dialog if in debug level that wasn't 0 or 1.	Also changed this
	  dialog such that the characters which make up the symbol are
	  always visible between the symbol and the callsign, whether in
	  debug mode or not.  I want to see this information.

2002-03-27 09:38  we7u

	  display.  Only three of the four options are currently
	  implemented.

2002-03-26 15:43  we7u

	* src/main.c: Added timestamp output to stderr on segfault.

2002-03-26 15:36  we7u

	  renamed to get_hours() and get_minutes().  Added get_seconds()
	  routine.  Added code to wx.c:cycle_weather() routine to do the
	  logfile timestamps.  Cycle_weather currently runs every 30
	  seconds.

2002-03-22 23:20  we7u

	* xastir.spec.in: Trimmed down version that still works nicely.
	  Installs /usr/local/bin/xastir as SUID root.

	  showing up in the middle of tnc data.

2002-03-18 21:25  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.pico: Changes hinted at by Jeff Brenton,

2002-03-11 15:36  we7u

	* config/: tnc-startup.kam, tnc-startup.kpc3, tnc-startup.sys:
	  Changed "mfilter off" to "filter off" for kam and kpc3.  Added
	  "filter off" to tnc-startup.sys as well.  Both mfilter and filter
	  are in that file, making it work for both types of TNC's.

2002-03-11 12:53  we7u

	* src/lang.c: Added a bit of bulletproofing for lang.c.

2002-03-11 10:49  we7u

	  Adding "mfilter off" to most tnc startup files.

2002-03-11 01:17  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Increased inter-character delay to 25ms.
	  PicoPacket doesn't work with 20ms.  This is only for writes on
	  serial port TNC's.

2002-03-11 00:06  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.pico: Fullduplex not recognized by my
	  PicoPacket.  Fulldup is.

2002-03-10 23:39  we7u

	  startup file.

2002-03-07 12:58  we7u

	* src/gps.c: Changed a few variables to globals.  This is to allow
	  two different GPS sentences to update the current info, then
	  perform a screen update using the combined data.  Fixed the code
	  so that receipt of one valid GPS sentence doesn't disable
	  decoding of the next.

2002-03-07 12:49  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.pico: Swapped the order of the GPS string
	  captures.

2002-03-07 12:49  we7u

2002-03-07 10:56  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.pico: Proper commands for a Pico.	Tested.

2002-03-07 10:55  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added a delay after sending each init string to
	  a serial TNC.  This is needed to allow the TNC enough time to
	  process the command before sending the next.

2002-03-07 08:58  we7u

	* Makefile.am: Adding a backslash that was erroneously deleted from
	  Makefile.am.	Thanks to Jack Twilley for pointing this out.

2002-03-06 17:02  we7u

	* config/: Makefile.am, tnc-startup.pico: Added a startup file for
	  a Paccomm PicoPacket.

2002-03-06 15:58  we7u

	* src/gps.c: Setting the time from GPS data now requires only that
	  a $GPRMC string be received, the OS be Linux, and that the Xastir
	  binary must be SUID root.  It no longer requires the $GPGGA
	  sentence to set the time.

2002-03-06 13:57  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	  config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	  config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Spanish.sys,
	  src/main.c: Changed 20 & 10 second GPS update rates down to 15 &
	  5.

2002-03-06 13:13  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added station trails for the local station.  Improved
	  station/trail update rate for Track-Me mode.

2002-03-06 11:48  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added the capability to track ourselves.  Uses the
	  Track Station facility, so the map moves when we get too near the
	  edge of the viewport.

2002-03-06 10:11  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c: Added a missing mutex unlock that was
	  preventing getting to the properties dialog for the new interface
	  type.

2002-03-06 01:52  we7u

	* src/gps.c: Blanking out fields for which we don't have actual
	  data values.

2002-03-06 01:44  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added else clause s.t. it changes the type to
	  "aprs data" if the nmea tests fail.

2002-03-06 01:29  we7u

	* src/interface.c: A few small tweaks to tnc_get_data_type().
	  Wasn't detecting NMEA data properly.

2002-03-06 01:17  we7u

	* src/gps.c: Updating local position after decoding each GPRMC or
	  GPGGA string.

2002-03-06 01:03  we7u

	* src/gps.c: Now updates local position when either $GPRMC or
	  $GPGGA are received.	Both are not required except for setting
	  time.  Added #ifdef __linux__ around the settime call.

2002-03-06 00:30  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Modified tnc_get_data_type() function so that it
	  doesn't call the decode_ax25_line() function.  The latter
	  function is destructive to its first parameter, which is the APRS
	  packet.  It was causing the packet to be destroyed before it

	  Changes by Owen DeLong <owen@delong.com>:  Changing to bit-mapped
	  debug levels.  Added new interface type "Serial TNC w/GPS on AUX
	  port", which is for Kantronics KAM, KPC3+, and Paccomm PicoPacket
	  TNC's that respond to <CTRL>-E for fetching GPS strings.  Added
	  new DEBUG_LEVELS file that describes the new standard levels.
	  Added more debug statements througout the code.  Added comments
	  for GPGGA sentence.  Added "dbadd" parameter to decode_ax25_line,
	  if it's set on return, add the data to the database.	Filter
	  "cmd:" out of incoming data.	Decode time/data from GPRMC and
	  GPGGA strings, used to set system time to GPS time.  Altitude
	  units now decoded from GPGGA strings.  Changed hard-coded device
	  numbers to ennumerated values.  New black background choice.
	  Added "char *envp[]" to parameters for main.

	  Still needed: Set time fixes for other operating systems.  Smooth
	  time transition instead of force to new value.  "Set Time" button
	  for remaining two GPS interface types.
