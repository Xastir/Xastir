2006-11-14 16:28  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.156): Changes to make it obvious in the configure
	  output text and in Help->About that we're using the internal
	  Shapelib.  This change doesn't affect summary.log.

2006-11-14 15:41  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.725): Putting a newline in front of the Motif
	  version string in Help->About.

2006-11-14 08:19  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.155): Fix the "-I" flag in CPPFLAGS when local
	  shapelib is being built.

	  As it was, the compiler would not find the local shapefil.h file
	  unless you were building in the actual xastir source code directory,
	  or if shapefil.h was already installed system-wide.

	  Noticed this while attempting a fresh build on a brand new laptop,
	  on which I'd decided to attempt the simplest possible build, with no
	  shapelib installed.

2006-11-13 19:46  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.29): Added notes about the private copy
	  of Shapelib and when it might be used, the "wget" requirement for
	  the get-NWSdata script, putting in a callsign when initially
	  starting Xastir, and a list of various places to get Xastir help.

	* INSTALL (1.89): Adding info about the alternate method of getting
	  Shapefile support.

2006-11-13 15:10  tvrusso

	* README.Contributing (1.14): Fix up a mistake in the description
	  of "build directories", and add a reference to that technique to an
	  earlier section that advocates doing all the builds in the source
	  directory.

	  Build directories are such a powerful tool for developers, we should
	  make sure we recommend it when talking about doing multiple builds.

2006-11-13 14:56  tvrusso

	* README.win32 (1.137): Attach a date to qualify the meaning of
	  "latest" in the ImageMagick section.

2006-11-13 14:48  tvrusso

	* src/Makefile.am (1.42): Add a testawk_LDADD line to
	  src/Makefile.am so that this test program can link if shapelib is
	  not installed.

	  I have no idea why this didn't fail when I was testing the shapelib
	  addition.

2006-11-13 14:25  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.136): Updating the description for ImageMagick
	  bug.

2006-11-13 14:24  we7u

	* src/.cvsignore (1.5), src/shapelib/.cvsignore (1.2): Adding

2006-11-13 01:36  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.724): Enabling default map on initial startup, plus

	* src/shapelib/contrib/Makefile.am (1.2): Add CVS revision
	  information and copyright.

2006-11-12 00:11  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.85): Adding attribution for the default map.

2006-11-11 23:46  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.154), src/shapelib/Makefile.am (1.2),
	  src/shapelib/shprewind (1.2), src/shapelib/contrib/.cvsignore
	  (1.1), src/shapelib/contrib/Makefile (1.2),
	  src/shapelib/contrib/Makefile.am (1.1),
	  src/shapelib/contrib/Makefile_orig (1.1): Add EXTRA_DIST and
	  DIST_SUBDIRS lines so that the shapelib stuff is properly bundled
	  when doing a "make dist" for release.

	  The Makefile.am in the contrib directory does not actually build any
	  of the contrib codes.  That's another step for another moment.  I
	  just wanted to make sure that any make dist that is done is sure to
	  bundle the entire shapelib directory in order to comply with the
	  terms of the license.

	  The "Makefile_orig" script in the shapelib/contrib directory could
	  be used temporarily to build the shapelib tools.  Ultimately, they
	  could be built by the new makefile, but it's not really the goal of
	  this exercise to do all that.  In fact, at some point it might be
	  reasonable for xastir's shapelib directory to contain only the files
	  needed for building the library, but that will probably require
	  modifying it to be under GPL instead of LGPL.  That's just a matter
	  of editing some license files, not any code.

	  Also, removed the shprewind file from the shapelib directory.  This
	  is a linux binary that for some reason was in the shapelib source
	  tarball I had.  It should never have been added to xastir's CVS
	  repository.

	  Make a loud warning if we do so, because the result of this is that
	  we'll have a bigger executable.

	  This commit is bigger than it needs to be, because it includes all
	  of shapelib, including the contrib directory.

	  Added an automake-generated Makefile for this thing.

	  Builds only a static library, and calls it "libshape.a" instead of
	  "libshp.a" so that if we use ask to use the static one while there
	  is also an external one installed, the linker doesn't pull in the
	  shared library one unbidden.

	  This stuff can be tested on a system with libshp installed by
	  configuring with "--without-shapelib"

	  I will be removing Makefile.in because it's not supposed to be in
	  CVS.  My mistake.

2006-11-09 16:23  we7u

2006-11-06 01:16  tvrusso

	* README.win32 (1.135): Add information about problems with Cygwin
	  ImageMagick.  The notes in the README.win32 refer to "recent
	  versions" of cygwin containing ImageMagick 5.5.7, which is very
	  outdated.  Current versions of Cygwin come with 6.0.4, and there are
	  real problems due to that version being linked with Display
	  Postscript support --- X.org stopped supporting that, and now
	  ImageMagick doesn't work on Cygwin unless you find a few DLLs off
	  the net.

	  The paragraph I added here points the user at an article that
	  explains the issue and shows two workarounds (installing the DLLs or
	  building ImageMagick from source code instead).

2006-10-05 14:46  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.592): Some SKY bulletins came in that had "EMERGENCY"
	  in the text.  This caused Xastir to try to process the packets twice
	  on order to get a position first and then pop up the emergency
	  dialogs.  Since there was no position in the packet this caused an
	  infinite loop as Xastir passed the packet through the processing
	  again and again.  The fix is to NOT send a packet through the
	  processing again, which will make it necessary for Xastir to receive
	  two EMERGENCY packets if a position is not known yet for the
	  station, but it will at least not cause Xastir to get in an infinite
	  loop.  We also skip storing any SKY packets now as they just take up
	  memory and we never do anything further with the packets.

	* src/interface.c (1.264): Add comments to show where it is
	  necessary to fix data_out_ax25 so that it isn't confused by leading
	  white-space in commands.

	  No code changes.  The idea was to document what I know I need to do
	  to fix the problem that Mike Fenske saw when the \r was added before
	  MYCALL commands.  The quick fix was not to add the \r if sending to
	  an AX25 port, but the clean fix would be to make data_out_ax25 not
	  care about leading white space.

2006-09-20 03:14  tvrusso

	* src/interface.c (1.263): What might be a less intrusive way of
	  introducing that extra carriage return into the MYCALL line.

	  The code for AX25 ports tries to decode the mycall line, and that
	  decoding was getting confused by the leading \r.  This quick "fix"
	  simply checks to see if we're writing to an AX25 port, and if so,
	  doesn't add the \r.

	  A more correct way to fix this would be to fix the decoding of
	  MYCALLs by data_out_ax25 so it doesn't get tripped up by the first
	  \r.  This is meant to be a quick hack to let both things work
	  properly until I figure out how to desensitize data_out_ax25.

2006-09-20 02:55  tvrusso

	* src/interface.c (1.262): Removing carriage return I had put in
	  before MYCALL sent to TNCs.

	  The original intent was to do what was supposed to be an
	  inconsequential extra carriage return when writing to the TNC to
	  work around  some garbled data issues that are happening on D700s.

	  Unfortunately, some bit of code downstream of "output_my_aprs_data"
	  is seeing the extra carriage return and screwing up.  Bleah.

	  Removing the "fix" until I figure out what is going on.

	  needs to filter mouse events.
	  3) Added, but haven't yet internationalized display of area in acres

2006-09-15 16:59  tvrusso

	* src/interface.c (1.261): Inexplicable fix for an equally
	  inexplicable but very persistent problem.

	  My Kenwood D700 complains loudly ("EH?") almost every time Xastir
	  tries to set MYCALL before a posit.

	  This commit adds a carriage return right before MYCALL is sent.  For
	  whatever reason, this eliminates the problem.  Clearly, the d700
	  gets in some strange state where the first command sent after
	  re-entering command mode is not recognized every time.

	  Since a failure of MYCALL to be set before transmit can mean the
	  wrong callsign (or NOCALL) being attached to a posit, this is
	  potentially a significant fix.  I will comment more on it in a
	  follow-up email to the users mailing list.

2006-08-21 11:44  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.712): Changing from a 1us delay to a 2ms delay

2006-08-19 18:54  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.256): A fix for the circular queue pointer
	  problem.  The read pointer was not getting advanced in the same

	  off-by-one error.

2006-08-19 17:42  we7u

2006-08-18 13:57  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.123): Added some comments.

	* src/interface.c (1.254), src/interface.h (1.37), src/main.c
	  (1.711): Shortening the delay at the end of UpdateTime() again to
	  10.  Global variables for passing data from the read threads to main
	  have been changed to a circular queue.  This lets us queue up data
	  from the read threads when we're busy drawing maps and such, then
	  process it quickly when we're freed up.

2006-08-18 11:02  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.52): Shortening delays so that we don't corrupt

2006-08-14 19:38  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c (1.59): Changing from "sed --in-place" to "sed

2006-08-14 19:34  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c (1.58): Fixing findu.com fetch trail function for

2006-08-14 15:52  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.152): Limiting to screen size instead of

2006-08-14 12:12  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.151), src/map_shp.c (1.120), src/maps.c
	  (1.496), src/maps.h (1.63): Removing error-text parameter from
	  map_visible_lat_lon() as we're not using it.  Changed the order of
	  checks in map_visible_lat_lon() to perhaps speed things up slightly
	  based on which lines get his most often (gprof). Changed skip
	  parameter for HandlePendingEvents in map_shp.c from 50 to 64, which
	  is a power of 2 (perhaps faster?) and roughly the switchover point
	  (via gprof) for lower CPU.

	* src/maps.c (1.494), src/util.c (1.215): Getting rid of duplicate

	  populated.  We have duplicate functionality in the
	  f_NW_corner_longitude, f_SE_corner_longitude, f_SE_corner_latitude,

2006-08-10 16:15  we7u

2006-08-09 14:03  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.104): Limiting params to X11 drawing calls

	  should be ok.

2006-08-09 11:36  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.566): Added a debug line and comment.  This one lets

2006-08-08 14:34  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.564): Fix for ambiguity box not getting disabled.

2006-08-08 13:05  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.490): Added some comments about possible
	  optimizations in the draw_point and draw_point_ll functions.

2006-08-08 12:36  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.489): Moving some of the functions to a different

	  config/tgrplc00.dbfawk (1.8), config/tgrwat.dbfawk (1.10): Fix
	  broken dbffields variables in all dbfawk files.

	  The dbfawk file is supposed to have semicolon-terminated statements.
	  Unfortunately, the parser is busted and doesn't actually handle the
	  case where the semicolons are omitted correctly.  So, for example,

	   BEGIN {
	    dbfinfo="Blah:Diblah:Diblahdiblah";
	    dbffields="Blah:Diblah:Diblahdiblah" }

	  winds up getting the newline-space at the end of the line added to
	  dbffields, and thus in the list of names to be retrieved from the
	  dbf file.  This never matches the last field when applied to the dbf
	  files, which have no such extra characters in the field names.

	  This bug is masked by *how* the dbffields variables were actually
	  set in the included dbfawk files:
	   BEGIN {
	    dbfinfo="Blah:Diblah:Diblahdiblah";
	    dbffields="Blah:Diblah:Diblahdiblah"}

	  That is, since there was no newline between " and }, dbfawk didn't
	  do the wrong thing.

	  Unfortunately, many people have patterned their own dbfawk files
	  after the ones in the config directory, and so this
	  missing-semicolon deal got propagated (I am among those propagating
	  it, as all my shape_web dbfawk files omitted the semicolon, but also
	  put the brace right after the ").  The problem only gets exposed
	  when the user inserts a newline after the quote.

	  This commit adds the semicolon (and a newline) after the dbffields
	  closing quote.

	  The real fix is to fix the dbfawk/awk parser so it doesn't let
	  syntax errors like this slip through.

	  (1.53): Renaming the global variables describing the corners of
	  the map window.  Fixes for aloha circles and multipoing drawings so
	  that they should appear if the symbol they're attached to is
	  off-screen.

2006-08-07 13:49  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.100): Getting rid of unused code.

2006-08-07 13:37  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.487): Adding clipt(), clip2d(), clipt_long(), and
	  clip2d_long() functions.  These are implementations of the
	  Liang/Barsky/Slater line-clipping algorithm.  Modified draw_vector()
	  and draw_vector_ll() to use them.  Changing cutoff points for
	  points/vectors to be consistent (+/-16000).

2006-08-07 13:33  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.562): Changing draw_trail() to use the draw_vector()
	  function.

2006-08-07 13:27  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.146), src/map_shp.c (1.115): Tweaking the pixel
	  min/max cutoff numbers to make them consistent throughout the code.

2006-08-07 11:13  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.99): Changed one comment.  No code changes.

2006-08-04 14:35  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.486): Changed draw_point() so that if it lies
	  outside the screen we don't call the X11 draw routine.

2006-08-04 12:57  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.98): A fix for dead-reckoning where the
	  angle goes whacko at close-in zoom levels.

2006-08-04 11:42  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.561): Setting the precision rectangle sizes for our
	  own station, whether transmit is enabled or not.

2006-08-04 11:17  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c (1.57): Using raw.cgi instead of rawposit.cgi to
	  fetch packets from findu.  This allows us to snag ALL packets from
	  the station during the specified period instead of just posits.
	  Weather, status, etc.

2006-08-04 10:55  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.560): Fixing the display of altnet's.  Somewhere
	  along the line we reversed it accidentally.

2006-08-03 23:32  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.559): Tweaking the NMEA decoding routines so that
	  they pass back the number of digits after the decimal point.
	  Changing the display for NMEA so that the number of digits changes
	  the size of the "precision" rectangle.

2006-08-03 23:26  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.213): Fixing convert_lat_s2l() and
	  convert_lon_s2l() so that they can handle from 0 to 6 characters
	  after the decimal point for lat/long conversions.

2006-08-03 15:57  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.558), src/objects.c (1.41): Fixing the problem where
	  objects don't appear on the map after created.  Also fixed
	  transmission of objects so that if they have a course/speed the new
	  position is sent out at the transmit interval.

2006-08-03 10:46  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.35), src/db.c (1.557), src/draw_symbols.c
	  (1.97), src/draw_symbols.h (1.25): The beginnings of the correct
	  way of drawing the "precision" rectangles.  Not all of the different
	  types of packets are correctly sized yet, but many are.

2006-08-03 00:19  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.556), src/draw_symbols.c (1.96), src/draw_symbols.h
	  (1.24): Changing "precision" circles to rectangles, with the
	  correct direction offset from the symbol for the different
	  hemispheres.  They are slightly too large at the moment, but at
	  least of reasonable size.

2006-08-02 15:26  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.212): The chdir() call in log_data() appears to
	  corrupt our "file" parameter.  We don't appear to need the chdir()
	  function call anyway, so have commented it out.  We get passed the
	  complete root-anchored path/filename as-is.

2006-08-02 12:30  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.555): Allowing the Station Chooser dialog to be
	  closed without forcing the Station Info dialog to be closed.
	  Commenting out the restore_position section in Station_data() as it
	  isn't working correctly.

2006-08-02 11:58  we7u

	* src/objects.c (1.40): Changed/added some comments.  No code
	  changes.

2006-08-02 11:53  we7u

	* src/objects.c (1.39): Backing out the update of the Edit & Delete
	  CAD Objects dialogs when allocating the first vertice of a new CAD
	  Object.  It's a bit confusing when the windows move on top of the
	  drawing area when you do the first click, so I decided not to update
	  then.

2006-08-02 11:47  we7u

	* src/objects.c (1.38): Updating the Edit and Delete CAD Objects
	  dialogs at more places:
	  *) When we create the first vertice on a new polygon
	  *) When we hit either the Done or Cancel buttons on the Close
	     Polygon dialog.

2006-08-01 14:49  we7u

	* src/objects.c (1.37), src/util.c (1.211): Effectively removing
	  the rounding code that was added on 6/21/2006.  The rounding was not
	  done properly to take into account overflow from seconds to minutes,
	  or from minutes to degrees.

2006-08-01 12:49  we7u

	* src/popup_gui.c (1.25): Bumping up the min size for popup
	  messages slightly.

2006-08-01 12:40  we7u

	* src/popup_gui.c (1.24): A start at fixing the problem where a
	  popup message will come up too small on the screen and can't be
	  resized.  We now set a minimum size and don't fix the size, so it
	  can be resized if necessary to read the message.

2006-07-31 13:42  we7u

	* src/objects.c (1.36): Fixed double-dash option for CAD objects.
	  Update Edit/Erase CAD object dialogs if objects are changed.  Use
	  "<Empty Label>" names if no actual label is selected.  Commented out
	  one message to STDERR during normal pre-defined objects processing,
	  fixed up another message here to use get_user_base_dir() or
	  get_data_base_dir() as appropriate.

2006-07-31 13:30  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.253): Notifying the operator if emergency
	  beacon mode is enabled but no transmits are actually occuring, for
	  various reasons.

2006-07-31 13:28  we7u

	* src/messages.h (1.19): Cranking up max message windows from 10 to
	  25.

2006-07-31 13:27  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.708): Warning the user if ALTNET is enabled on
	  startup (can be confusing when a new user sets this and then sees no
	  stations).  Setting a fixed beacon interval of 60 seconds if
	  emergency beacon mode is enabled.

2006-07-31 13:25  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.212), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.201), config/language-French.sys (1.202),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.209), config/language-Italian.sys
	  (1.202), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.199),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.209): Adding more strings for
	  popup messages throughout the code, plus language strings for CAD
	  Objects.

2006-07-25 14:53  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.210): A first attempt at snagging course/speed out
	  of the previous posit if the last posit doesn't have it, for
	  dead-reckoning purposes.  It will only do this if the previous posit
	  is still within the dead-reckoning timeout period.  The goal here is
	  to do dead-reckoning properly for stations which alternate
	  GPGGA/GPRMC sentences (GPGGA don't have course/speed).

2006-07-24 19:04  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.95): Removing dead or useless code.
	  Reorganizing some of the tests where we determine whether to draw a
	  particular symbol or attribute based on whether it is in the current
	  view.

2006-07-24 19:01  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.554): Changing to setting flags in the station record
	  when it's our station or object/item, then checking flags, instead
	  of checking the "call_sign" or "origin" constantly throughout the
	  code with string compares.  Got rid of the second drawing iteration
	  where we were drawing new stations to the screen _and_ to
	  pixmap_final.  We now draw to the screen and rely on the next full
	  screen-update to do the rest.

2006-07-24 18:54  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.707): Fixing the -geometry flag so that it works
	  for strings like: "-geometry -0-0"

2006-07-22 14:47  tvrusso

	* src/dbfawk.c (1.32): Possible fix for bug that prevents dbfawk
	  files with a single field in the dbffields list from working unless
	  a colon is added to the end of the list.

	  This appears to be a very platform dependent bug, as I have never
	  been able to reproduce the problem.  But the fix is still valid ---
	  the issue is that no null terminator is added to a field name unless
	  a colon is found.

	  This fix doesn't break anything, but I'm unable to verify that it
	  actually fixes the problem reported, since I have never actually
	  seen that problem in action.

2006-07-20 20:05  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.485): Dump a couple of messages out from
	  map_indexer() to STDERR.  This makes it evident why Xastir is so
	  busy when first started up in a fresh config directory, if there are
	  a lot of maps present on the system.

2006-07-20 19:28  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.706): Nope, 50 was too slow, but 25 looks good so
	  far.

2006-07-20 19:23  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.705): Slowing down the main UpdateTime() loop
	  again.  We seem to keep up with a 2.6 kernel with nexttime=50.
	  Previously 10.

2006-07-19 14:40  we7u

	* src/igate.c (1.56), src/interface.c (1.252), src/main.c (1.704),
	  src/maps.c (1.484), src/messages.c (1.65), src/xa_config.c
	  (1.157): Fixes to get rid of complete path in the config file for
	  variables that need to change between different configs.  If a user
	  has specified a complete path (other than the default path), Xastir
	  will honor it.  If the default path is there, Xastir will shorten it
	  so that multiple configs may use it.

2006-07-19 11:27  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.34), src/db.c (1.553), src/list_gui.c (1.43),
	  src/objects.c (1.35): Getting rid of many of the is_my_call()
	  invocations, instead setting flag bits in the DataRow->flag variable
	  to specify whether it's our callsign-SSID or whether it's an
	  object/item owned by us.  This gets rid of literally millions of
	  string compares.

2006-07-18 00:41  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.552): Skip doing dead-reckoning if scale > 8000.
	  Doing point-caching of last-point-drawn in draw_trail() to reduce
	  the amount of drawing we do when it's the same screen pixel over and
	  over (when zoomed out).

2006-07-18 00:38  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.33): Adding a new flag definition in
	  preparation for a rewrite of the is_my_call() function.

2006-07-17 16:12  we7u

	* src/map_WMS.c (1.22), src/map_geo.c (1.68), src/map_tiger.c
	  (1.50): Patch for bug 1522493 by Dan Brown, n8ysz:  The caching
	  "bad" files problem.  It should whack things out of the cache if,
	  for whatever reason, they're unusable.

2006-07-17 11:57  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.703), src/xa_config.c (1.156), src/xa_config.h
	  (1.8): More tweaks by Dan Brown, n8ysz:  Cleaned up the
	  get_user_base_dir() in xa_config.c to be more careful about
	  returning complete paths.

2006-07-16 19:02  tvrusso

	* src/color.c (1.18), src/map_geo.c (1.67): Clean up transparency
	  code for .geo maps, removing debug output.

	  This now works properly for 16 and 24 bit DirectColor/TrueColor
	  displays.  It is horribly broken for 8-bit displays, but as far as I
	  can tell it was horribly broken *before* I started.  On 8-bit
	  displays the WMSRadar image doesn't even get displayed, transparent
	  or not, before *and* after my changes.  I was unable to figure out
	  why.

2006-07-16 17:21  tvrusso

	* src/color.c (1.17), src/map_geo.c (1.66): An interim commit of
	  partial fixes to the transparency problem on .geo files.

	  Mostly committing this to get it to a machine that has a display
	  that isn't 24-bit for testing.

	  Lots of cruft in here needs editing out after testing is complete.

2006-07-14 18:50  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.28), xastir.1 (1.12): Updates by Dan
	  Brown, n8ysz.

2006-07-14 15:53  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.702), src/xa_config.c (1.155): Additions/fixes to
	  implement alternate Xastir config directories.  Patch submitted by
	  Dan Brown, n8ysz.

2006-07-13 12:10  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata (1.7): Fixing up the domain names so that
	  they all match (for consistency).

2006-07-12 17:47  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata (1.6): Updating one NWS shapefile name to
	  latest version.

2006-07-12 17:47  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.84): Updating the text for NWS Shapefile names to
	  match the NOAA website.

2006-07-12 14:24  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.94): A fix for the bug where text-on-black
	  obscure text above/below slightly due to the black background.  We
	  now separate the text by another pixel and the problem goes away.

2006-07-11 16:06  tvrusso

	* WMSRadar.geo (1.8): Tweak transparency value.  For some time now,
	  the actual "no reflection" value that's been coming in has been hex
	  value  0x010101, not "0x000000".  On 24-bit displays that means that
	  the default file was displaying with an opaque nearly-black
	  background instead of a transparent one.

	  The actual no-reflection value returned by the WMS server has
	  changed back and forth between 0x000000 and 0x010101 often in the
	  history of the WMSRadar file and will probably need to be changed
	  again some time in the future.  It has been pretty consistently
	  0x010101 for several weeks now.

2006-07-11 14:38  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.551): Fixing incorrect timestamps for local station.
	  This was causing track points to get expired immediately so that the
	  station didn't show a track if being run with only a GPS interface.

2006-07-11 13:02  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.93): Fixes for dead-reckoning 180 degree
	  problem and for the DR arc being slightly off.

2006-07-11 12:18  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.92): Removing dead code.

2006-07-11 12:06  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.91): More efficient dead-reckoning code
	  plus commenting out unused sections of code.

2006-07-11 11:41  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.90): More tweaks to dead-reckoning.  We now
	  attempt to display the arc and the DR'ed trail if either the symbol
	  or the DR'ed symbol are on-screen.  Added an "if" clause to the
	  DR'ed symbol drawing so it is only drawn when on-screen.  Commented
	  out old code that we're not using anymore.

2006-07-11 11:01  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.209): Another fix by Dan Brown, n8ysz.  This one
	  keeps the log files at or below the max logfile size.

2006-07-11 10:59  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.251): Removing a duplicate include line.
	  Thanks to Dan Brown for finding it.

2006-07-11 03:15  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.89): Implenting DR arcs again.  Problems
	  near/at 180 degrees, but other than that it seems to work fine.

2006-07-10 17:24  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.550): Disabling the XtRemoveGrab() function call
	  which causes warnings on some OS'es.  I don't believe we actually
	  need it.  We'll find out for sure when more users try out this
	  version.

2006-07-10 17:23  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.88): Test code for re-enabling the
	  dead-reckoning arc's.  Not complete/correct yet, but it's a start.

2006-07-10 16:40  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.63): Fixes by Mike Loebl, kb1mts, to add barometric
	  pressure and humidity decoding to ARNE format.

2006-07-10 12:57  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.701): Fixing high CPU usage problems on FreeBSD,
	  changing nexttime from 2ms to 10ms.  Thanks to Carl Makin for this
	  tweak.

2006-07-10 11:09  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.208): Fixes by Dan Brown, n8ysz, for Xastir bug
	  1518805:  "Log files can fill up hard drive".  We now limit a log
	  file to about 2MB at which point we roll it over to a new filename
	  and create a new empty file to write to.  We keep up to 3 of these
	  backup files plus the current log file at any given time, which
	  makes for between 6MB and 8MB of data that we keep.

2006-07-07 16:10  we7u

	* README.Contributing (1.13): Added a section by Dan Brown.

2006-07-07 15:06  we7u

	* scripts/BUILDRPMS (1.8): Tweaking the rev number.

2006-07-06 16:23  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.700): Fixes by Dan Brown, n8ysz, for Xastir bugs
	  1515197 "segfault if XASTIR_USER_BASE no existing" and 1517761, "No
	  error check on config dir mkdir".

2006-07-06 15:36  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.699), src/track_gui.c (1.56): Fixes for the blank
	  label problem on sliders with certain releases of OpenMotif.  This
	  relates to problems with using XtVaTypedArg within an
	  XtVaCreateManagedWidget() function.  Instead we now call
	  XmStringCreateLocalized() before the call, and XmStringFree()
	  afterwards.

2006-07-05 14:17  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am (1.38), src/main.c (1.698): A patch to add
	  compile time/date to the Help->About dialog, by Dan Brown, N8YSZ.

2006-06-29 17:04  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.154): Making the igate -> RF path default be
	  "WIDE2-1".

2006-06-27 14:25  we7u

	* src/igate.c (1.55): Reorganizing the logic slightly to make it
	  easier to understand w.r.t. the gating of objects/items/stations to
	  RF via the nws-stations.txt file.  Added/updated several comments.

2006-06-23 16:03  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.549): Adding more comments.  No code changes.

2006-06-23 15:31  we7u

	* src/igate.c (1.54): Changing igating->RF around so that if a
	  station or object name is found in the nws-stations.txt file, it
	  will get gated to RF whether or not "TCPXX" is found in the path.
	  This allows more types of things to be gated to RF if manually
	  specified in the nws-stations.txt file.

2006-06-22 12:42  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.548): Mostly changes to comments, but changed the
	  error ellipses from black to white.  Still need to draw truncation
	  rectangles instead in some cases.

2006-06-21 14:49  we7u

	* src/objects.c (1.34): Tweaking the rounding in objects.c

2006-06-21 13:12  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.207): Changing some comments.

2006-06-21 12:41  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.250), src/util.c (1.206): Fixing up posits so
	  that we round properly instead of truncating the higher resolution
	  digits.  For some-odd reason the fprintf doesn't round up properly
	  at 0.5, so we add a 0.01 to the number so that it rounds up.

2006-06-21 11:51  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.547): Changing one comment.

2006-06-20 12:55  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.32), src/db.c (1.546), src/draw_symbols.c
	  (1.87): An attempt to do the error ellipses for position packets.
	  This is most likely not the display we'll finalize on, but it's a
	  start.  We draw circles for the less-precise posits, but as Tom
	  Russo pointed out they should probably be rectangles.  Also, the
	  GPGGA/GPRMC/GPGLL code needs some work w.r.t. these.

2006-06-19 21:47  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.545), src/draw_symbols.c (1.86), src/draw_symbols.h
	  (1.23): Making sure we don't try to do dead-reckoning on stations
	  that have position ambiguity enabled.

2006-06-19 18:58  we7u

	* README (1.32): Adding notes for OpenSuSE 10.1

2006-06-16 20:29  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.544), src/draw_symbols.c (1.85), src/draw_symbols.h
	  (1.22): More ambiguity fixes.

2006-06-16 19:58  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.31), src/db.c (1.543): Correcting the spelling
	  of "ellipse".

2006-06-16 19:08  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.84): Changes to a few comments.

2006-06-16 19:06  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.30), src/db.c (1.542), src/draw_symbols.c
	  (1.83), src/draw_symbols.h (1.21): Adding a variable for doing
	  error_ellipses around posits.  Not in use yet.  Changed the position
	  ambiguity around so that it is correct and the symbol position
	  inside the rectangle is correct.  Still need to fix up the
	  grid-square code in the draw_ambiguity function though.

2006-06-15 21:28  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.82): Fixing up some of the ambiguity
	  rectangle stuff.  All but the grid squares look ok now, but the
	  smallest rectangle ends up with the symbol placed off-center, which
	  still needs to be fixed.

2006-06-15 19:46  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.81): Changing from stippled ambiguity
	  rectangles to solid lines.

2006-06-15 14:33  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.80): Changing ambiguity rectangles from
	  filled to unfilled, plus drawing lines from symbol to each corner of
	  rectangle so we know which symbol is being drawn with the ambiguity.

2006-06-14 20:55  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.29): Doesn't make much sense to add the new
	  parameter to the station database at this time when code doesn't use
	  it.  It would only take up memory.  Commenting it out for now until
	  we get to using it.

2006-06-14 20:50  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.28): Preliminary addition of an error_elipse
	  storage area for the station record.  Not actually used in the code
	  yet as we're still discussing how it should best be used/displayed.

2006-06-14 14:17  gstueve

	* src/util.c (1.205): Only check VHF porion of path. Still need to
	  process 2nd portion for proper behavior.

2006-06-14 14:13  gstueve

	* src/util.c (1.204): Only change lower case characters to uppper,
	  don't bother to rewrite upper.

2006-06-14 14:10  gstueve

	* src/util.c (1.203): Fix spelling in comment.

2006-06-12 16:17  we7u

2006-06-08 21:04  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.541), src/objects.c (1.33): Changed some comments to
	  show the last GPROF percentages for the heavy-hitters.  No code
	  changes here.

2006-06-07 14:18  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.d700 (1.9): Changed the comments at the top.
	  Added note about Alinco's.

2006-06-07 14:03  tvrusso

	* FAQ (1.66): Update pointer to latest version of the FAQ.  The
	  URLs that were here were very outdated.

2006-06-06 19:22  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.540): Some packets with an extra digit in the
	  latitude end up going through the compressed packet decode routine.
	  This fix causes those packets to be rejected from that routine.

2006-06-05 22:01  we7u

	* Davis/src/db2APRS.c (1.6): Davis mods by Clay Jackson, n7qnm.
	  Added some MySQL error checking, set it up so it would always get
	  the 'latest' records, and generally improved the error handling
	  (things like 0 or >100 pct humidity, pressure below 26 or above 31,
	  and so on).

2006-06-05 19:20  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata (1.5): Tweaking the script so that it only
	  fetches files we don't already have.

2006-06-05 19:19  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.150): Bumping revision for devel to 1.8.3.

	  number.

2006-06-05 17:14  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.83): Added a section describing how to create your
	  own Shapefile maps with Xastir.  Added a section describing CAD
	  Object polygons.

2006-06-05 16:46  we7u

	  look for it in the scripts directory.

2006-06-01 17:04  we7u

	* scripts/Makefile.am (1.22): Adding gpx2shape to the build.

2006-06-01 17:04  we7u

	  Convert GPX files to Shapefiles.

2006-06-01 16:35  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.81): Added a blurb about National Geographic's
	  Topo, TPO/TPG files, mapXchange, gpsbabel, and gpx2shape.pl.

2006-06-01 14:17  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.80): A bit added by Kyle Kienapfel regarding the
	  Canada topo file.  Thanks!

2006-05-31 20:39  we7u

	* src/igate.c (1.53): Disallowing igating of general queries in

2006-05-31 20:36  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.539): Added some comments.

2006-05-31 19:57  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.538), src/wx.c (1.62): Fixing the backwards
	  conversions for wind speed for Peet Bros.  Ultimeter-II weather
	  stations.  The correct units are km/h if the sentence begins with
	  '#', and mph if the sentence begins with '*'.

2006-05-31 19:30  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.61): Changes to comments/added some comments.

2006-05-31 18:39  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.60): Zeroing the first two digits on wind speed for
	  Peet Bros 2k as per the docs.

2006-05-31 18:25  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.59): Changing a few variables to make the code more
	  consistent.  Instead of pointing back to the original data to check
	  for ">7", we look at the first character of our substring
	  temp_data1[0].

2006-05-31 18:09  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.58): Fixes for Peet weather stations, negative value
	  decoding.

2006-05-30 20:06  we7u

	* src/map_gnis.c (1.30): Fixes to make Xastir handle the type of
	  GNIS files found at:
	  <http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/download_data.htm> which have
	  shorter lines than the ones at: <http://geonames.usgs.gov/stategaz/>

2006-05-30 18:50  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.249): Really complicated fix for Xastir

	  put in.

2006-05-30 16:07  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.537): Changed one comment.

2006-05-30 15:18  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.27), src/db.c (1.536), src/interface.c (1.248),
	  src/main.c (1.697): A bug fix for KISS or AGWPE ports.  The AX.25
	  header increases in size when it gets converted to TAPR2-style
	  headers.  If there were enough digipeaters in the path then the
	  complete packet can get truncated on the tail-end.  This patch fixes
	  it by allocating a separate buffer that is quite large for each
	  packet before the header decoding function.

2006-05-17 19:28  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.535): Fixing the reply-ack problem during messaging.
	  It was an off-by-one error.  Our ack_string looked like "}5o"
	  instead of "5o", which made the comparison fail.

2006-05-13 16:27  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am (1.37): Adding rpl_malloc.h to the build.

2006-05-12 20:32  tvrusso

	* FAQ (1.65): Add command for converting Root files to new scheme.

	  Of course, if someone could check this file out to see the commands,
	  they've already done the conversion...

2006-05-12 20:05  we7u

	* scripts/do_xastir_release_dev (1.4): Fixing a typo.

	  SourceForge.

2006-05-12 19:44  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.d700 (1.8): Adding "HEADERLN off", which we
	  appear to have missed at some point.

2006-05-04 15:01  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.133): Added a note about what to call COM1/COM2
	  in Cygwin.

2006-04-29 17:19  tvrusso

	* symbols/symbols.dat (1.27): Change \V symbol (VORTAC) to

	* src/rpl_malloc.c (1.1), src/rpl_malloc.h (1.1): Separating out

2006-04-21 21:01  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.533): Correcting spelling in one comment.

2006-04-21 20:51  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.532): This change clears the transmitted message so

	  printf to STDERR for each REJ.

2006-04-21 19:58  we7u

2006-04-10 14:31  we7u

	* scripts/get-maptools.sh (1.1): Script to get/install several of

2006-03-16 08:03  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS (1.79): Fixx mispleling.

2006-03-14 01:32  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.530): Refusing to do the emergency popups
	  until/unless we have a position for a station.  It's hard to help
	  someone if we don't know where they are at.  This keeps Xastir from
	  annoying the crap out of people every 30 minutes if a posit for that
	  station isn't coming in, but a packet with certain keywords _is_
	  coming in regularly.

2006-03-10 20:56  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.85): Added another note about libtiff-3.8.0

	  appear only under the correct circumstances.

2006-03-09 02:43  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.529): Initial implementation of a distance check for
	  warnings/alerts.  Default is set to 280 miles or kilometers
	  (whichever mode you are set in), and the check defaults to ON,
	  meaning it will check each time whether the station is within that
	  distance.  This version has no user controls for the new
	  functionality implemented yet.

2006-03-08 02:44  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.55): Fixing the rounding for some of the values that

	* README.MAPS (1.73): Adding a bit about the get-NWSdata script.

2006-03-07 17:04  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata (1.2): Modified the script to do one
	  download/unzip/delete the .zip file, then start on the next.  This
	  will keep disk space requirements down plus not have the .zip files
	  hanging around when we're all done.

2006-03-07 16:53  we7u

	* scripts/get-NWSdata (1.1): A new script to fetch NWS data files
	  used for weather alerts.  Curt, WE7U and Steven, WM5Z had a hand in
	  writing it.

2006-03-03 20:31  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.528): Checking for 8-bit characters in Mic-E packets,

	  skip the check.

2006-03-03 16:19  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c (1.54): Re-enabling the popup on findu track
	  download failure, as it doesn't appear to be the source of James
	  Ewen's segfaults when his DNS failure occurs.  It appears to be a
	  segfault from libcurl itself.

2006-03-02 22:53  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.129): Added a note about compiling libproj into
	  gdal statically in order to install on Cygwin.

2006-03-01 16:02  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c (1.53): Adding comments near another popup
	  message that could conceivably cause segfaults:  The "Success"
	  message from fetching a findu trail.  This particular popup has
	  worked properly for me with no segfaults so far.  We may need to
	  investigate whether multiple threads writing to X11 at the same time
	  can cause segfaults.  I believe I've seen this in other cases, but
	  my memory may be faulty on this matter.

2006-02-28 08:01  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c (1.52): Getting rid of the GUI stuff in fetch

2006-02-27 21:02  we7u

	  arguments to XtVaSetValues.

	  I coulda *sworn* I had just copied what was already there, but
	  apparently not.

	  This fixes the problem where the Incoming Data scrolled text widget
	  was not scrolling to the bottom of the incoming data as new stuff

2006-02-24 18:38  tvrusso

	* src/db.c (1.526): Complete refactor of how the
	  "packet_data_string" stuff is updated and displayed.

	  We no longer do "memmove" to cycle old data out of the array, but
	  rather use a two-dimensional array of strings treated as a ring.
	  Data is shifted out of the Display Incoming Data dialog box using
	  XmReplaceText calls.

	  I have tested this out in several ways and it appears to function
	  precisely as the old one was intended to do.  This *might* be the
	  solution to the sporadic segfaults we've been seeing and the less
	  harmful "line too long for array" warnings.

2006-02-24 00:38  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.525): Add a null pointer check to
	  delete_station_memory(). Changed an "if" to an "else" clause in
	  insert_new_station(), which just made the code slightly simpler but
	  didn't change any operation.  Multiple comment changes.

2006-02-24 00:01  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.152): Increasing the default for Internet Map
	  Timeout from 90 to 120 seconds.

2006-02-23 23:59  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.200): Adding messages something like "Possible

	  wget code.

2006-02-22 16:53  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c (1.481): Adding grid labels for UTM major grid.  All

	  section.

2006-02-19 19:48  tvrusso

	* scripts/Makefile.am (1.20), scripts/object2shp.pl (1.1): Per
	  discussion on xastir mailing list, a script to create shapefile maps
	  from the object.log file.  This will enable quick and dirty
	  generation of special purpose map overlays by plunking down objects,
	  creating shapefiles, then deleting the objects.

	  new/old/rejected messages.

2006-02-15 16:46  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c (1.480), src/maps.h (1.59): Refinements to the

	  Reduced the number of variables being passed in the functions called

2006-02-14 19:34  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.518): Making the Incoming Data display's char array
	  manipulation code a bit less scary.  It had the potential to

	  extremely unlikely to occur.

2006-02-14 19:33  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.246): Bumping up the sizes of some char
	  arrays.  Just because.  Probably don't help much, but don't hurt

2006-02-12 02:10  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.515): Doing some more error-checking in the station
	  record pointers.  We do an abort() if we end up with dangling
	  pointers, which should give us a core dump immediately.

2006-02-10 20:27  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.17), configure.ac (1.148): Tweaks to add more

	* README.Contributing (1.9): Adding a debugging note from Tom
	  Russo.

2006-02-09 21:27  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.56): Change XASTIR_COMPILER_FLAGS so that it
	  doesn't insert "-g -O2" unconditionally.  That is unnecessary since
	  we call AC_PROG_CC, which *conditionally* inserts "-g -O2" into
	  CFLAGS if the user hasn't specified CFLAGS on the configure line.

	  This should allow users to build specialized debugging versions such
	  as ./configure CFLAGS="-O -g -fno-inline" and not have configure
	  stick a "-O2" in unbidden.

2006-02-09 20:41  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.477): A temporary fix to skip computing the

	  Removing that command from update-xastir so that the default will be
	  to create a core file.

2006-02-06 21:35  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.472): Some fixes for segfaults and divide-by-zero
	  faults in the draw_grid() function.  At least one more segfault path
	  remains in this body of code.

2006-02-06 17:03  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.691), src/maps.c (1.469), src/util.c (1.198),
	  src/xastir.h (1.52): Added degree and minutes symbols to lat/long
	  grid border labels by adding constants for convert_xastir_to_UTM()
	  to produce strings containing these symbols.  Truncation of trailing
	  zeroes on UTM grid labels, with number of zeroes removed depending
	  on utm_grid_spacing_m.  Changed following feedback from use of
	  printed maps during a GPSAR training.  Added internationalization
	  for lat/long and UTM grid border metadata.  Added metadata on top
	  border for labeled lat/long grids.  Latitude drawn on both left and
	  right borders.  Put the xastir coordinate to MGRS conversion into a
	  function that extracts the components of the MGRS string separately,
	  then made convert_xastir_to_MGRS_str() a wrapper around this
	  function in prepration for labeling the MGRS grid.

2006-02-02 17:57  we7u

	* README.Contributing (1.7): Adding info about core dumps and how
	  to bring up a debugger.

2006-02-02 16:49  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.25), src/main.c (1.690): Reversing the
	  meaning of the "-t" command-line flag:  The segfault handler is now
	  turned off by default (meaning we'll dump core instead).  The "-t"
	  flag turns on the internal segfault handler now instead of disabling
	  it.

2006-02-02 16:04  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.147): Commenting out the code that removed the
	  "-g" GCC option.  As Tom pointed out, it was a bad idea.

	  longitude grid.

2006-01-31 18:32  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c (1.466): More tuning of labeled border for UTM grid.
	  Added Zone number and letter in all four corners when two zones are
	  shown.  All text in border changed to black with border color
	  outline.  For two zones, northings for one zone appear on the left
	  side of the screen northings for the other on the right.  The left
	  zone is labeled in black, the right zone labeled in blue.  Minor
	  fixes to turn off display of labels where they run off the screen.

2006-01-30 15:31  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.146), src/maps.c (1.465): "roundf", recently used
	  in maps.c, is a newer extension that is not present in systems that
	  still have old C compilers.

	  Insert a check for roundf, and a workaround for systems that don't
	  support it.

	  syntax instead of Bash.

2006-01-28 04:36  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c (1.464): Minor changes and bug fixes to the UTM grid
	  border labeling code.  Includes rounding of the grid labels to
	  correctly label 10,000 m, 1,000m, and 100m grids, not just the 100m
	  grid.

2006-01-27 23:40  chicoreus

	* src/maps.c (1.463), src/rotated.c (1.17): Added code to
	  RotatedTextItem in rotated.c library to handle special case of
	  rotation of text 90 degrees counter clockwise.  In this case, text
	  is rotated by directly transposing x and y coordinates, rather than
	  by applying a sine and cosine transformation to rotate the text,
	  something that produces an italic appearance to the rotated text
	  (making it harder to read, especially when printed).  This change is
	  to support more legible text on the labeled UTM grid on the border
	  of the map, especially for producing maps to be printed.

	  Also made minor changes to border label code in maps.c to make quick
	  and dirty improvements to appearance.

2006-01-27 16:30  we7u

	* Davis/bootstrap.sh (1.7), LaCrosse/bootstrap.sh (1.4): Since the
	  three bootstrap.sh scripts are the same anyway, run the one from one

	  of them when a change is needed.  Like, duh!

2006-01-27 16:14  we7u

	  based on number of signals available.  We then use this to decide
	  whether to set "OLD_PTHREADS", which enables or disables the SIGUSR1

	  Linux Pthreads used SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 in their implementation.  We

	* src/db.c (1.506), src/main.c (1.683), src/main.h (1.89),
	  src/maps.c (1.455): First cut at adding a labeled border to the
	  map shown on the screen for printing.  This can be used, for
	  example, to print maps with a labeled UTM grid for a SAR task team
	  showing the area they are to search.  Metadata about the map is
	  displayed in the top border, coordinates of grid lines are displayed
	  on the bottom and right borders (to make it easier for people to
	  correctly read and report UTM coordinates in the form zone easting
	  northing.  The labeled border is displayed when both the grid and
	  the border are enabled.  There are still problems and missing
	  features.  The rotated font on the right border is not the pretty
	  font used on the rest of the border.  The border and grid labels are
	  only drawn for a UTM grid, not for a Lat/Lon grid.  Zone designators
	  are not properly displayed when more than one zone is visible on the
	  screen.  When grid lines are closely spaced, the grid labels overlap
	  on the screen.

	  (1.191), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.188),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.198): First rough cut at adding a
	  labeled border to a map to allow the printing of arbitrary maps with
	  a labeled grid (that can, for example, be printed and given to SAR
	  task teams).  If the map grid is enabled, and the border is enabled,
	  a white border is drawn as part of the grid and labels for each grid
	  line are added in this border.  Metadata describing the map are also
	  added in the border.  This is a first rough cut with several
	  problems.  It is only implemented for a UTM grid, not for a Lat/Long
	  grid.  The rotated numbers do not use the same clean font as the
	  non-rotated numbers.  The labels in the border are not clearly
	  distinguishable when the grid is tightly spaced on the screen.  The
	  zone labels do not work properly when more than one zone is on the
	  screen.  The choice of labeling the bottom border and the right
	  border with the UTM grid line easting and northings is deliberate to
	  help people to correctly read the map and report UTM coordinates in
	  the form: zone easting northing.

	  toolbar and the View and Map menus.  Added some text for Probability
	  Circle Objects.

2005-12-08 01:04  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.243): Only twiddle DTR on HSP ports if global
	  transmit is enabled.

2005-12-08 01:02  we7u

	* src/objects.c (1.25): Very minor formatting change.  No code
	  changes.

2005-12-07 20:40  we7u

	* config/Makefile.am (1.27): Automating the deletion of the
	  nwsfzddmmyy.dbfawk file from the /usr/local/share/xastir/config
	  directory during install.  We don't use it anymore and it causes
	  problems if present.

2005-12-07 18:38  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.242): Patch by Paul Morris, modified slightly
	  by me, to make objects work for the case when global transmits have
	  been disabled.

2005-12-07 17:32  tvrusso

	* config/Makefile.am (1.26), config/nwsfz_ddmmyy.dbfawk (1.8):
	  Remove unnecessary (and problematic) nwsfz_ddmmyy.dbfawk file.

2005-12-07 16:09  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.143): Moving some struct typedef's and nested
	  functions out of the main function so that it will compile with
	  latest MacOSX GCC compiler.

2005-12-07 06:41  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.112): Made code more correct by changing
	  alert->title to modified_title in a couple of places.
	  modified_title is a copy of alert->title so the real-world effects
	  of this change are little to none.  Tweaked some comments in the
	  area as well.

2005-12-07 03:04  tvrusso

	* config/nwsmzddmmyy.dbfawk (1.13): Fix incorrect key generation
	  for mzddmmyy.shp file.

	  The key produced by the dbfawk rule must match the key that comes
	  from the NWS alert.  These will generally be "XX_Zyyy".  The "ID"
	  field of the mzddmmyy.dbf record is of form "XXZyyy", and prior to
	  this commit it was used directly as the key, thereby never matching
	  any alerts.  This fix inserts the _ character after the first to
	  characters of the ID field to produce a usable key.

2005-12-06 21:35  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.111): Added more debugging text for dbfawk and
	  wx alerts.

2005-12-06 20:53  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.454): Correcting some comments.

2005-12-06 20:50  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.453): Adding a bit more text to one wx alert debug
	  message.

2005-12-06 20:26  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.241): Moving a nested function so that it is
	  no longer nested.  This is necessary in order to compile on MacOSX
	  with their latest GCC compiler.

2005-12-06 19:34  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.193): Changing a nested function to non-nested in
	  order to enable compiling with the latest MacOSX compiler.

2005-12-05 03:05  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.679), src/xastir.h (1.49), src/festival.c (1.17):
	  Adding a "Test" button to the Configure->Speech dialog for testing
	  the speech subsystem and for adjusting the audio levels (by an
	  external program).

2005-12-01 19:32  we7u

	* update-xastir (1.9): Changing the "make" step so that it doesn't
	  run as root.

2005-12-01 17:22  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.142): Commenting out and include that we're

	  it easier/faster to interrupt map drawing by panning or zooming.

2005-11-28 20:51  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.109): Adding capability to interrupt map drawing
	  and start over in the inner loops of the GNIS and DOS map drawing
	  functions.  This makes panning or zooming cause an interrupt much
	  quicker while drawing maps, allowing Xastir to restart the redraw
	  process sooner.

2005-11-28 20:43  we7u

	* src/map_dos.c (1.20), src/map_gnis.c (1.27): Adding capability to
	  interrupt map drawing and start over in the inner loops of the GNIS
	  and DOS map drawing functions.  This makes panning or zooming cause
	  an interrupt much quicker while drawing maps, allowing Xastir to
	  restart the redraw process sooner.

2005-11-23 22:37  we7u

	* scripts/do_xastir_release_stable (1.1): Adding another admin
	  script so that it won't get lost.

	  repository so that it won't get lost.

2005-11-23 22:27  we7u

2005-11-22 20:35  we7u

	* NWS-TEST.log (1.3): Moving all of the tests to the Northwest

2005-11-08 19:15  gstueve

	* src/main.c (1.670): We already have a good idea of what time it

	  This is not a '25 or 6 to 4' need.

2005-11-08 14:52  gstueve

	* src/database.h (1.21), src/db.c (1.504), src/main.c (1.669): Make

	  better.

2005-11-07 00:14  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.192): Fixing the remove_trailing_dash_zero()
	  routine.  It was changing "-10" into "-1" which is quite wrong.

2005-11-03 20:15  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.501), src/interface.c (1.239): Making sure we don't

2005-11-01 19:18  gstueve

	  with WIDEn-m paradigm.

2005-10-27 04:58  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.238): Truncating transmitted posits at the
	  spec-specified length.  Long comments can't make us transmit
	  out-of-spec packets anymore.

2005-10-27 04:52  we7u

	* src/sound.c (1.15): Added a missing include that causes a problem
	  on Solaris if missing.

2005-10-26 19:16  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.667): Re-enabling the messages to STDERR when

	  comment about disabling SIGHUP handler in child processes.

2005-10-26 19:14  we7u

	* src/hostname.c (1.24), src/macspeech.c (1.5), src/sound.c (1.14),
	  src/x_spider.c (1.46): Regressing to default SIGHUP handler in

2005-10-26 19:07  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.13): Added date stamps and more comments.

2005-10-26 15:46  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.666): Changing the messages that appear as Xastir
	  shuts down, putting them back under debug_level control in
	  restart().  restart() gets called multiple times due to sending
	  SIGHUP to the TCP/UDP servers during shutdown, and the messages were
	  appearing multiple times if those servers were running.

2005-10-26 01:01  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.189): Fixing the alert expiration problem.  May
	  need to be checked when we switch out of daylight savings time
	  again.

2005-10-25 20:08  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.665): Adding an include so that we can use the
	  ComboBox widget.

2005-10-25 20:04  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.664): Limiting the selection box for preconfigured
	  object filenames on the Configure->Defaults dialog to three items.

2005-10-25 19:53  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.663): Minor cleanups of the predefined object code:
	  Added a few free's for XmStrings, allocated memory before an
	  XtGetValues call.

2005-10-25 19:25  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.188), src/util.h (1.42): Making rpl_malloc()
	  compile in all cases and put a prototype for it in util.h to get rid
	  of more compiler warnings.  rpl_malloc() only gets used if
	  AC_FUNC_MALLOC detetcs a version of malloc that doesn't return a
	  valid pointer if you try to malloc zero bytes.

	  These changes make it compile ok on FC4.

2005-10-25 15:18  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.187): Added some comments.

2005-10-25 03:37  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.12): Added some notes about future directions
	  we could go to make the tests a bit more complete.

2005-10-25 03:36  we7u

	* FAQ (1.60): Tweaked the "restart Xastir" paragraph to keep it
	  up-to-date.

2005-10-24 19:29  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.662), src/main.h (1.86): Patch to allow SIGHUP to
	  cause Xastir to restart properly.  This patch also appears to carry
	  along the original command-line parameters and environment to the
	  new task.  The xastir.pid file is correct in all cases, and in fact
	  the main process ID doesn't change between restarts.

2005-10-24 19:27  we7u

	* src/macspeech.c (1.4): Spawning a separate process for sending
	  the text to the Mac OSX speech subsystem.  We also incorporate a
	  limit of 10 processes that can be waiting for the subsystem to be
	  freed up.  If 10 processes are waiting and another speech request is
	  made, the latter is dropped.  No provision is made for the ORDER
	  that the (up to) ten processes get access to the speech subsystem
	  either so the order will most likely get mixed up if you're trying
	  to send speech strings out too fast.

2005-10-24 15:52  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.111), src/main.c (1.661), src/objects.c
	  (1.17), src/objects.h (1.4): Another SAR patch from Paul Morris.
	  Here's what he says:  This one implements a dialog for selecting CAD
	  objects to delete from the Erase All CAD polygon menu item along
	  with implementing delete by name in CAD_object_delete().  It also
	  adds some help text on prepared objects and CAD objects and changes
	  the XmStringCreateLocalized() calls to XmStringCreateLtoR().

2005-10-22 04:46  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.660): Restarting on SIGHUP a bit better.  It now
	  sends argv[] at least the first time around.  Need to figure out why
	  the 2nd time doesn't work at all.  Perhaps signal handlers are
	  getting messed up on reboot?

2005-10-21 20:28  we7u

	* src/objects.c (1.16): Another tweak by Paul Morris for proper
	  handling of CAD objects.

2005-10-21 19:33  we7u

	* FAQ (1.59): Reworded text for SIGHUP.

2005-10-21 19:27  we7u

	* FAQ (1.58): Adding the SIGHUP stuff to the FAQ.

2005-10-21 19:18  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.23): Added some more signals to the
	  External Stimuli section.

2005-10-21 19:11  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.659): Adding support for SIGHUP.  Xastir will
	  save/exit/restart if a SIGHUP is received.  Also enabled a #define
	  near the top of main.c that enables the xastir.pid processing.  If
	  someone attempts to start Xastir and there's a process running with
	  that PID, Xastir will exit.

	  The SIGHUP support works, but the command-line parameters aren't
	  carried through as the normal processing for them devours them out
	  of the argv[] array.  We need to save that array away or use a
	  non-destructive method of processing the parameters.

	* src/objects.c (1.15): Small tweak so that the code looks in the
	  /usr/local/share/xastir/config directory for the predefined objects

	  files with local user files.

2005-10-21 17:41  we7u

	  and changed invocation to "projUV" instead.

2005-10-15 16:42  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c (1.30): Fixing a problem caused by the new code
	  which fixes the gdal/geotiff bug.  This fix cuases the original
	  functions to be called if gdal isn't installed.

2005-10-14 18:06  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c (1.29): Received permission from Frank Warmerdam to

2005-10-13 00:09  we7u

	* src/messages.c (1.60): Added code that will switch back to RF if

2005-10-12 20:09  we7u

	* src/messages.c (1.59): New message routing which should take care

2005-10-11 17:12  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.499): Added a bit of debugging.  No effect for normal
	  operation.

2005-10-11 15:16  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.498): Slightly better igating of messages.  This
	  versions saves the message+acks away and then uses that exact string
	  again when igating it, instead of putting together the bits and
	  pieces at that point like the previous code.

2005-10-11 05:07  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.497): Another tweak to get reply-ack's propagated
	  through an Xastir igate to RF.  This one is tested and works.

2005-10-11 01:29  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.496): Comment changes.  Also changed the fprintf()
	  for REJ packets to only dump text to STDERR if the REJ was sent to
	  my_callsign.

2005-10-10 19:11  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.495): Changed one comment.

2005-10-10 18:52  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.494): Added comments.  fprintf() to stderr when we

2005-10-10 18:48  we7u

	* src/messages.c (1.58): Minor tweaks w.r.t. REPLY-ACK protocol.

2005-10-10 16:31  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.493): Fixing igating of messages to RF for messages
	  with REPLY-ACK protocol at the end.  We were originally sending our
	  processed ACK at the end which knocked off the free-ack portion.
	  Now we send the full five-character unprocessed REPLY-ACK.

2005-10-10 16:29  we7u

	* src/igate.c (1.49): Adding some comments.

2005-10-10 15:23  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.652): Fixing a couple of compiler problems via

2005-10-08 01:16  we7u

	* src/objects.c (1.10): Tweaks to avoid other object/item/station
	  names when creating SAR objects.  Xastir will now add a number to
	  the end of the typical name (starting at "2") in order to create a
	  unique name.  This makes for extremely fast placement of important
	  mission objects without worrying about old mission objects or
	  conflicting with other people's current missions.

2005-10-06 05:49  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.646): Casting to type "Dimension" is not proper for
	  parameters passed to XtSetArg().  Have changed to variables of that
	  type for parameter passing.  Also cleaned up the -geometry code a
	  bit.  The windows are now sized properly per the command-line
	  parameters.

2005-10-06 00:25  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.645): A better version of the -geometry code that
	  is starting to work on Cygwin.  The size is larger than specified,
	  perhaps because it is based on char sizes instead of pixels?
	  Anyway, this part of the code is starting to work.

2005-10-05 18:37  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.644): Rearranging things.  No code changes.

2005-10-05 15:34  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.643): Another attempt at the -geometry stuff.  Here
	  we only use size_hints in one case, plus we lock down the minWidth
	  and minHeight of the main widget when we create it (to the size we
	  want it to appear as), but change those parameters before we map the
	  window to the screen.  This method was borrowed from the Lincity
	  project where they do similar things.  As usual, this stuff works
	  for me on Linux/FVWM2.

2005-10-04 19:12  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.642), src/xa_config.c (1.146): Another shot at this
	  -geometry stuff.  Moved the size_hints stuff after the window is
	  mapped.  Added an icon.

2005-10-04 16:11  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.641): Reducing the number of size_hints variables

2005-10-03 20:13  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.145): Tweaking SCREEN_ZOOM to match new

	  src/track_gui.c (1.48), src/view_message_gui.c (1.31),
	  src/wx_gui.c (1.42): Getting rid of the Global.top widget which
	  was unmapped.  Making appshell be the top level widget.  Added
	  parsing for the -geometry command-line variable via XParseGeometry()
	  so that we can tell when either the height/width or the x/y offsets
	  have been specified.  We then set up appshell based on that info or
	  using the config file data if it wasn't specified on the
	  command-line.

2005-10-02 00:46  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.631): Commenting out base_width and base_height

2005-09-30 18:02  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.630): Another shot at the XSizeHints stuff
	  (-geometry).  Learning a bit more with each iteration.

2005-09-30 15:58  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.629): Of course some of those I commented out

2005-09-30 15:51  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.628): Getting rid of a few unused variables.

	  This gives it a higher priority.

2005-09-30 13:46  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.106): Updating the xastir_udp_client
	  description.

2005-09-30 12:26  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.490): Telemetry fix which adds it as status to the
	  station record, submitted by Andrew Rich, vk4tec.  Thanks!

2005-09-30 09:50  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.626): Took another look at the XSizeHints struct.
	  Might work better now to provide proper geometry hints to window
	  managers.

2005-09-29 19:19  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c (1.28): Casting to the correct type for X11 calls.

2005-09-29 19:19  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.489), src/location.c (1.8), src/main.c (1.625),
	  src/map_WMS.c (1.16), src/map_dos.c (1.19), src/map_geo.c (1.60),
	  src/map_gnis.c (1.25), src/map_pdb.c (1.14), src/map_shp.c
	  (1.105), src/map_tiger.c (1.44), src/maps.c (1.448),
	  src/objects.c (1.2), src/popup_gui.c (1.20): Casting to the
	  correct type in X11 calls.  Adding more debug output to
	  create_appshell() for -geometry stuff.

2005-09-29 18:00  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.52): Fix by  Thorsten Lockert.  Fixes a problem
	  on MacOSX where -lgdal can have revision numbers after it.  Without
	  this fix the test compile using gdal fails.

2005-09-29 15:42  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.624): Added more debugging output for -geometry.

2005-09-29 14:59  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.623): Moving some variable declarations to the
	  correct spot.  Ended up originally putting them after a bit of
	  functional code, but they must be at the start of a block for many
	  compilers.

2005-09-29 14:37  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.622): Changing to 3rd-party packets for packets
	  sent from UDP to the RF ports.

2005-09-28 20:21  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.621): Commenting out some unused variables.

2005-09-28 20:02  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.620): More mods for UDP->RF.  This version may be
	  working but it needs testing on a system with real RF interfaces to
	  see if it behaves properly.

2005-09-28 16:24  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.619), src/x_spider.c (1.45), src/x_spider.h (1.10):
	  Continuing work on support for UDP server port.  We're getting
	  closer now to supporting sending of packets to RF.

2005-09-28 16:22  we7u

	* src/xastir_udp_client.c (1.8): Changed the help text.

2005-09-28 16:03  we7u

	* symbols/symbols.dat (1.25): Adding the /F, Farm Equipment,
	  symbol, as a green tractor.  Also added hash mark delimiters between
	  each symbol definition.

2005-09-28 14:50  we7u

	* config/language-German.sys (1.183): Updates by Andreas Bier,
	  dl1hrc.  Thanks!

2005-09-27 15:16  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.618): Simplifying startup of the application in
	  main().  Changing to XtVaOpenApplication, which supersedes the
	  function call we were using before, and removing some explicit
	  function calls that are handled automatically by both the old and
	  the new function call (unnecessary code).  These changes are being
	  made to implement proper support for the "-geometry" command-line
	  flag.

2005-09-26 02:35  we7u

	* src/alert.h (1.23), src/database.h (1.19), src/db.c (1.488),
	  src/draw_symbols.c (1.76), src/geocoder_gui.c (1.18),
	  src/interface.c (1.234), src/main.h (1.84), src/maps.h (1.56),
	  src/track_gui.c (1.47), src/util.h (1.40), src/Makefile.am
	  (1.32), src/main.c (1.617), src/maps.c (1.447), src/util.c
	  (1.184): Moving the Object/Item/Cad_Object code into objects.h
	  and objects.c.

2005-09-26 02:26  we7u

	* src/objects.c (1.1), src/objects.h (1.1): Moving nearly all of
	  the Object/Item/CAD Object code into one header and one source file.
	  This makes main.c quite a bit smaller.

2005-09-24 18:21  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.616): Proper numeric checks for Global.top
	  size/offsets, for deciding whether to make the 2nd Xastir window
	  (the first visible window) copy either set of parameters.

2005-09-24 18:00  we7u

	* src/list_gui.c (1.37), src/main.c (1.615): Changing variables
	  used in XtVaGetValues() calls to "Dimension" or "Position".  Adding
	  an out-of-range check for dimension for the case where we're
	  attempting to discover whether the first window has had -geometry
	  specified.

2005-09-24 00:18  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.614): First working version of the "-geometry"
	  command-line flag.  Will hopefully know soon if it works on all
	  platforms we support.  Let the testing begin!

2005-09-23 19:01  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.613): "-geometry" switch now works for sizing the
	  application (instead of "-g"), but the X/Y offsets still don't work.

2005-09-23 02:18  tvrusso

	* src/main.c (1.612): Give "appshell_width" and "appshell_height"
	  initial values of 0.  This allows the contents of the xastir.cnf
	  file's SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT to be used if no geometry is
	  specified in -g.  As it was, if one didn't give -g then these two
	  settings in the config file were ignored and a 100x100 window
	  appeared on every start-up.

2005-09-22 20:32  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.611): A fix for Xastir hanging if the -g flag is
	  used but only offsets are specified.

2005-09-22 20:07  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.610): Initial implementation of the "-g" geometry
	  command-line flag.  It supports sizing the application, but doesn't
	  support X/Y offsets yet.  That's in the works though.

2005-09-22 05:29  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.187), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.177), config/language-French.sys (1.177),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.182), config/language-Italian.sys

	  (1.609), src/main.h (1.83), src/track_gui.c (1.46): Added
	  success/failure popups to findu trail download.  Changed
	  max_trail_colors to a define instead of an int.  Added a Change
	  Trail Color button to the Station Info dialog.

2005-09-21 18:51  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.186), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.176), config/language-French.sys (1.176),

	  (1.178), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.175),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.185), src/track_gui.c (1.45):
	  Popping up an error if the new backgrounded fetch findu trail fails.
	  Changing variables that the thread depends on to "static" so they'll
	  be around when the thread needs them.

2005-09-21 00:35  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.51): Restructure test for gv slightly, so that
	  AC_PATH_PROG is called first, and version is tested if gv is found.
	  The case where gv is found, but `gv -v | cut -d ' ' -f 1` not being
	  "gv" is in fact a sign of error that needs to be reported in a
	  meaningful way.

	  Turns out that when I do my normal cygwin build (which is usually
	  done in a non-X cygwin run to save memory), the old way of probing
	  gv found the gv executable, but because "gv -v" tries to connect to
	  the X server and reports failure if it can't, configure was telling
	  me that gv was found, but the build would actually happen without
	  gv.  This was quite confusing.

	  With the new test as committed here, I still can't build with gv
	  outside of an xterm on cygwin, but the reason actually shows up in
	  the configure output.

2005-09-17 18:33  we7u

	* src/lang.h (1.5): Bumping up the size of the language buffer as
	  we're bumping up against the limits now for some languages.

2005-09-16 23:46  we7u

	* src/xastir_udp_client.c (1.7): Changing some comments and the
	  usage text.

2005-09-16 23:45  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c (1.44): Trying to protect the track download so
	  that only one can be done at once.  Not perfect yet as sometimes the
	  GUI locks up.  More to do.

2005-09-16 23:34  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys (1.175): Changing "New Call" to "New
	  Station" for the speech strings.  I think it sounds better.

2005-09-16 21:09  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys (1.174): Adding an 's' to the end of
	  "Enable Server Ports".

2005-09-16 21:09  we7u

	* config/language-German.sys (1.180): Updates courtesy of Andreas
	  Bier, dl1hrc.  Thanks!

2005-09-16 20:18  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.105): Tweaking the text regarding the
	  UDP server/client.  Adding more about the -identify command-line
	  flag.

2005-09-16 20:14  we7u

	* src/xastir_udp_client.c (1.6): Making the output from the
	  -identify response go to STDOUT instead of STDERR.  Only makes sense
	  so it can be piped more easily into scripts and such.

2005-09-16 20:09  we7u

	* src/xastir_udp_client.c (1.5): Implemented the "-identify"
	  command-line flag.  The "message" portion must have at least a
	  single char in order for the identify query to be sent to the
	  server.

2005-09-16 19:37  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.104), src/x_spider.c (1.44): Now we send
	  UDP packets out the x_spider TCP ports as well, if the packet is
	  authenticated properly.

2005-09-16 19:26  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.43): Adding a "-identify" option to the UDP
	  server.  It returns a UDP packet containing the callsign.

2005-09-16 18:48  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c (1.43): Putting the fetch_findu_trail function
	  into a separate background thread.

2005-09-16 18:48  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.103): Adding text about the UDP server
	  feature and the xastir_udp_client.

2005-09-16 14:38  we7u

	* src/x_spider.h (1.9), src/xastir_udp_client.c (1.4): Moving the
	  default port for UDP from 2024 to 2023, as TCP and UDP can co-exist
	  on the same port number.

2005-09-15 23:59  we7u

	* src/xastir_udp_client.c (1.3): Fixed the hostname lookup.  You
	  can now specify any hostname and port.

2005-09-15 19:38  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.183): Adding the long integer time at the beginning
	  of the timestamp line for the log files.  Makes sorting easy.

2005-09-15 18:56  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.182), src/wx.c (1.52): Changing timestamping to add
	  a timestamp line per packet instead of once per 30 seconds.

2005-09-15 18:47  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.42), src/xastir_udp_client.c (1.2): Adding
	  authentication to the UDP packets.

2005-09-15 18:45  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.486): Allowing user-defined and telemetry packets to
	  be gated.

2005-09-15 14:54  we7u

	* src/.cvsignore (1.4): Adding xastir_udp_client to the ignore
	  list.

2005-09-15 14:52  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am (1.31), src/x_spider.c (1.41): Renaming the UDP
	  client from udp_client to xastir_udp_client.

2005-09-15 14:51  we7u

	* src/xastir_udp_client.c (1.1): Renaming this file from
	  udp_client.c to xastir_udp_client.c, to avoid similar names for UDP
	  clients.

2005-09-15 14:50  we7u

	* src/udp_client.c (1.2): Renaming this file to xastir_udp_client.c

2005-09-15 04:53  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.233), src/main.c (1.608), src/x_spider.c
	  (1.40), src/x_spider.h (1.8): Adding a UDP server at port 2024.

2005-09-15 04:45  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am (1.30): Adding the udp client.

2005-09-15 04:44  we7u

	* src/udp_client.c (1.1): Initial checkin of a UDP client.
	  Currently this is hard-coded to talk to the localhost address, but
	  that can be fixed later.  It also hangs currently if the server
	  isn't responding.

2005-09-09 20:08  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.485): Fixing a typo in one of the new langcode()
	  string callouts.

2005-09-09 19:20  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.484), src/main.c (1.607), src/util.c (1.181):
	  Replacing a bunch of hard-coded strings with langcode() strings.

2005-09-09 19:19  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.185), config/language-English.sys

	  (1.14), src/view_message_gui.c (1.30), src/xa_config.c (1.143):
	  Adding language strings for previously hard-coded values.  Changed
	  get_long and get_int functions in xa_config.c to give better output
	  when variables are missing or out-of-range in the config file upon
	  Xastir startup.

2005-09-09 04:40  we7u

2005-09-08 16:49  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.74): Adding a blurb about conflicts between GDAL
	  internal libraries and external libraries that Xastir can use.

2005-09-08 16:39  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.50): Move -lgdal to end of LIBS line if it's
	  found.

	  It is possible for gdal to be using its own internal geotiff
	  library, and this can interfere with use of an external one in
	  xastir.  Having it later in the line than geotiff can fix that.

	  This could cause problems for systems with busted linkers that need
	  gdal to be earlier than everything it depends on.  If that happens,
	  it might be necessary to add the contents of "gdal-config
	  --dep-libs" to LIBS after -lgdal.

2005-09-08 15:58  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c (1.27): Commenting out some unnecessary includes.
	  Adding some error messages when function calls fail.  Minor
	  reformatting w.r.t.  braces to match the Xastir project standard.

2005-09-07 19:30  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.606): Assuring that the "System time jumped
	  backwards 1 seconds!" message doesn't say "0 seconds!", as I've seen
	  recently due to the way the code was originally written.

2005-09-03 01:42  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.49): More appropriate output for the case where
	  gv is not found by configure.

2005-09-02 23:00  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.48): Adding a clause for the case where no usable
	  "gv" is found.

2005-09-02 22:34  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.47): Another stab at trying to do the "gv"
	  revision tests.

2005-09-02 22:34  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.446): Pop up warning messages if we try to print
	  but don't have the proper support compiled in.

2005-09-02 20:54  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.46), src/maps.c (1.445): Tweaks to hopefully
	  determine automatically which version of "gv" is being used and
	  change the code to correspond to the proper API.

2005-09-02 19:30  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.444): Preparing for configure.ac tests that will
	  determine the "gv" version, then we can change how we call up "gv"
	  based on that.

2005-09-02 15:47  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.39): Changing to a <CR><LF> combination for the
	  "Hello" server message, per the APRS INET conventions.

2005-09-01 17:00  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.21): Modified the note regarding
	  geocode files.

2005-09-01 15:08  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.137), src/main.c (1.605): Adding a test for
	  sigignore() to configure.ac, and code to use it in main.c.  We were
	  getting a warning under Solaris by using signal() with SIG_IGN as
	  the parameter.

2005-09-01 14:43  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.180): Adding strings.h include.  Need for Solaris.

2005-09-01 04:16  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.kpc3 (1.16): Removing "exp on" from the file.
	  I guess SOMEBODY doesn't think we need AEA commands in a KANTRONICS
	  config file.  The nerve!

2005-08-31 21:42  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.11): Blowing away the autom4te.cache
	  directory at the start of each run, to make sure that we start out
	  ultra-clean.

2005-08-31 16:59  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.136): Attempt to remove "-no-unused" from linking
	  stage for Cygwin builds, as GCC links to complain about that flag
	  during linking.

2005-08-30 21:19  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.45): Changing grep syntax so that it will work
	  with non-GNU grep (Solaris).  Getting rid of dash near the end.

	  Mucking about with the strings.h includes.

2005-08-30 20:28  kd6zwr

	* src/awk.c (1.31), src/geo-find.c (1.10), src/io-common.c (1.4),
	  src/map_gnis.c (1.23): protecting the strings.h with an ifdef,
	  and casting isspace() family of macros to match man page (int).

2005-08-30 19:41  we7u

	* src/awk.c (1.30): Adding a strings.h include for Solaris support.

2005-08-30 18:33  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.482): Displaying the raw packet in a dialog for the
	  case where we detect "EMERGENCY" in the comment field or one of the
	  emergency-type destination callsigns in a packet.

2005-08-30 18:31  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.paccomm (1.12): Commenting out a "WIDE" alias
	  that remained.  Changed it to "LOCAL" also.

2005-08-30 18:31  we7u

	* src/locate_gui.c (1.20): Skipping the dialog destroy call if you
	  hit the FCC/RAC lookup or the Locate button.  The dialog now has to
	  be manually cleared by hitting the Cancel button.

2005-08-29 15:06  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.481), src/interface.c (1.232), src/wx.c (1.51):
	  Fixing warnings seen on OSX 10.4.  Very minor "signedness" warnings
	  in string functions.

2005-08-28 00:21  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.38): Tweaking a patch provided by James Washer
	  that will send a string out the server port on each connect.  My
	  chances were merely to the format of the string.  Thanks go to James
	  for the patch itself.

2005-08-26 21:12  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.135), src/hostname.c (1.23): Fix so that
	  hostname.c can compile on systems that define neither sighandler_t
	  nor sig_t.  This is necessary because of the new cast to
	  sighandler_t of the second argument of signal() that was put there
	  to shut gcc warnings up.

2005-08-25 21:29  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.44): Getting rid of some extra restores of
	  variables that I shouldn't have added last go-around.

2005-08-25 20:48  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.43): Summary text and summary.log were incorrect
	  if gdal wasn't found.  Fixed.

2005-08-25 15:11  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.480): Commenting out some debug code.

2005-08-25 04:27  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.142): Simplifying the get_long() and get_int()
	  code per discussions with Tom Russo.  Also attempting to get rid of
	  some compiler warnings that we see with FreeBSD.

2005-08-24 17:58  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.603): Switching the state of trap_segfault variable
	  to make more sense.

2005-08-24 16:50  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.602): Change in text suggested by James Washer.
	  Also added the -t option to the command-flag help text.

2005-08-24 16:07  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.141): Removing some ill-advised casts to
	  time_t's.  Was trying to get rid of warnings that appear on FreeBSD,
	  but this was the wrong approach and didn't fix the problem.

2005-08-24 04:08  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.134), src/hostname.c (1.22): Change logic for
	  deciding when to use a sigjmp_buf vs. a jmp_buf.

	  The code that was originally here would only work if sigjmp_buf was
	  a #define, but on some systems it's a typedef.  The new code works
	  for both.

2005-08-24 02:53  we7u

	* src/awk.c (1.29), src/bulletin_gui.c (1.32), src/map_gdal.c
	  (1.139), src/maps.c (1.442): Fixing up function headers to be
	  ANSI-C compliant.

	  between the normal and the more unusual parameters.

2005-08-23 21:18  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.131): Changing some text on the summary output.
	  No code changes.

2005-08-23 20:52  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.42): Add configure-time check for usability of
	  -Wno-unused-parameter. Older compilers (not newer as was indicated
	  in the comments) don't like that and need -Wno-unused instead.

	  Return -W to the CFLAGS, and use whatever -Wno-unused* works.

2005-08-23 19:39  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.231): Added a new time_t variable that we can
	  use to call ctime() with, in order to avoid a compiler warning.

2005-08-23 19:38  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.140): Changing a bunch of pointer casts from

	* src/alert.c (1.95): Casting some time_t's to unsigned long's to
	  get rid of warnings.

2005-08-23 19:30  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.41): Taking some of the new compiler flags back
	  out as one of them isn't recognized on some versions of GCC, and the
	  other causes too many warnings without it.  Hopefully we can add the
	  "-W" back in at a later date once we figure out how to get rid of
	  the "unused parameter" warnings on a case-by-case basis.

2005-08-22 23:02  we7u

	* src/io-mmap.c (1.5): Cleaning up compiler warnings.

2005-08-22 22:21  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.40): Adding "-W" and "-Wno-unused_parameter"
	  compiler flags.  Still a clean compile with SuSE Linux 9.0.  No
	  errors, no warnings.

2005-08-22 18:45  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.478), src/interface.c (1.230), src/interface.h
	  (1.34): Added is_local_interface() and is_network_interface()
	  functions.  Changed packet_data_add() to use them, and to changes it
	  functionality so that packets transmitted to local interfaces would
	  be visible in the incoming data dialog.

2005-08-22 18:37  we7u

	* src/shp_hash.c (1.15), src/shp_hash.h (1.4): Fixing up prototypes
	  and function headers so that they are ANSI-C compatible.

2005-08-22 18:36  we7u

	* src/rtree/card.c (1.4), src/rtree/gammavol.c (1.4),

2005-08-22 18:35  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.10): Tweaking to match new format for

2005-08-20 01:27  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.71): Adding notes about malloc debugging.

2005-08-19 21:31  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.74): Adding/changing some comments.

2005-08-19 21:26  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.73): Real fix for memory leak in the font
	  metrics code.  Don't know why we need a '1' parameter for this
	  system call, but with a '0' we end up with a leak.

2005-08-19 20:32  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.72): Fix for big memory leak.

2005-08-19 18:33  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.130), src/hostname.c (1.21): Add probe for
	  sighandler_t definition, and code to work around it being missing.

2005-08-18 23:54  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.229): Fooled myself.  Last fixes weren't fixes
	  but stopped the compile.  Will rework that fix later.

2005-08-18 23:51  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.228): Putting a few casts in to get rid of
	  "-pedantic" warnings.

	  compiler flag will show fewer warnings.

2005-08-18 22:56  we7u

	* src/hostname.c (1.20), src/shp_hash.c (1.14): Fixing up minor
	  warnings that the "-pedantic" compiler flag revealed.

2005-08-18 22:27  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.94), src/db.c (1.476): Getting rid of another
	  couple of warnings that the "-pedantic" compiler flag revealed.
	  Very minor stuff.

2005-08-18 22:11  we7u

	* src/hashtable_private.h (1.5): Removing the semicolon at the end
	  of a function that "-pedantic" compiler flag caught.

2005-08-18 21:49  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.38), src/testawk.c (1.23): Make use of LIBS in

2005-08-18 21:43  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c (1.45): Casting to an "int" in order to get
	  around a compiler warning that we get if we turn on stricter
	  checking.

2005-08-18 21:42  we7u

2005-08-18 21:00  we7u

	* src/leak_detection.h (1.3), src/util.h (1.39): Tweaks by Tom
	  Russo to make the new include arrangement work on FreeBSD.
	  Evidently I broke that platform with my most recent include file
	  changes.

2005-08-18 15:28  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c (1.29): Moving the dmalloc code to a
	  separate header file.

2005-08-18 15:27  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.138), src/maps.c (1.440), src/wx_gui.c (1.41):
	  Messing with the hash iterator free's again.

2005-08-18 15:26  we7u

	* src/leak_detection.h (1.2): Here's where the malloc and dmalloc
	  code was moved to.  The order in which this is done with respect to
	  the libgc code is critical, therefore it has all been moved to this
	  one header file so the order can be closely guarded.

2005-08-18 15:24  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.92): Removing the dmalloc code.

2005-08-18 15:21  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.93): Getting rid of dmalloc ifdef's.  We use libgc
	  to do similar things.  Messing with the iterator ifdef's again.

2005-08-17 20:16  we7u

	  in all cases.

2005-08-17 20:13  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.439): Moving alert-related code to debug level 2.

2005-08-17 19:02  we7u

	* src/leak_detection.h (1.1): Moving the LIBGC defines/includes
	  into a new header file.  The order in which these are used in a C
	  module is important, as is the order that the thread includes are
	  done.  This will help assure that the order remains consistent so
	  that the memory leak detection will work.

2005-08-17 18:59  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.70): Tweaking the libgc instructions.

2005-08-16 00:47  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.175): Separating out the pointers so we can better
	  keep track of them, assuring that we're not overwriting anything we
	  shouldn't.  Freeing some malloc'ed space for the case where hash
	  inserts fail.

2005-08-16 00:45  we7u

2005-08-15 20:01  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.129): Adding a very short summary of the

	  debugging as we can more quickly see what passed/failed on a
	  particular user's machine.

2005-08-15 06:43  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.101): Committing Tom Russo's fix to remove colon

2005-08-13 16:43  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.124): Fixing a couple of typos.

2005-08-13 05:21  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.597): Moving one define to the top of the file.
	  This one contains some copyright dates and appears in the Help
	  dialog, so must be updated periodically.  This new location for it
	  is much better than having it hidden in the middle of the file.

2005-08-13 05:07  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.174): Adding spaces around the "==" in the #if
	  statement added today.

2005-08-13 03:17  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.37), configure.ac (1.128): Taking out the new

2005-08-12 21:37  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.36), configure.ac (1.127), src/util.c (1.173):
	  Adding rpl_malloc() function in util.c, and the associated hooks
	  into acinclude.m4 and configure.ac to get it called.  This is to

	  properly.

2005-08-12 21:36  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.69): Adding a note about libgc's extra memory usage.

2005-08-12 20:41  we7u

	  src/maps.c (1.437), src/util.c (1.172), src/wx_gui.c (1.39):
	  Added a reset button to the Change Debug Level dialog.  Made the
	  Enable WX Alerts menu item be grey'ed out if Shapelib not installed.
	  Added debug statements multiple places.  Put #ifndef's around a
	  bunch of free(iterator) statements for the case when libgc is
	  configured into the compile (else segfaults occur).

2005-08-12 19:27  we7u

	  menu.

2005-08-11 19:46  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.9): Added a default configure/compile at the

	  for the system it's run on.

2005-08-11 19:20  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.8): Removed a couple of el-stupido test
	  cases.  Nice'ed everything.

2005-08-11 01:37  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.126): Adding warnings so that library
	  dependencies are obvious.  Adding code so that missing dependencies
	  cause dependent libraries to be skipped.

2005-08-11 01:35  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.68): Added an ASCII-art drawing showing the library
	  dependencies.

2005-08-10 21:06  we7u

2005-08-10 18:58  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.124): Forcing use_rtree to OFF and issuing a

2005-08-10 18:39  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.593), src/shp_hash.c (1.11): Fixing the code for
	  the case where rtree has been requested buy Shapelib is not compiled
	  in.  It makes no sense to do this, but at least it will compile for
	  this case now.

2005-08-10 18:38  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c (1.41): Tweaking the Fetch Findu Trail function
	  so that it matches what findu is capable of for the trail duration.
	  Changed the start time and duration time max values to #defines at
	  the top of the file so we can change it more easily next time
	  around.

2005-08-09 15:57  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.35): Fix for broken fix of broken fix of probe
	  for gdal.

	  After I fixed the multiply-included -lgdal issue and made sure that
	  I'd separated out -Ls from -ls, I never made sure that the -l got
	  into LIBS.  I was counting on AC_CHECK_LIB to do that, but it only
	  does so if you don't provide an ACTION-IF-FOUND.

	* acinclude.m4 (1.34): Add ugly hack to work around gdal-config's
	  idiosyncratic merging of LDFLAGS and LIBS data with the single
	  "gdal-config --libs" command.  Other programs with -config scripts
	  have --ldflags and --libs to keep the stuff separate.

2005-08-09 03:18  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.33): Fix broken attempt to replace old flags into
	  variables after failing test.

2005-08-08 21:12  francais1

	* config/language-French.sys (1.171): Incorporated most changes
	  from Jacques Chion

2005-08-08 19:27  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c (1.40): Adding a debug statement.

2005-08-06 18:11  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.32): Fix up AC_CHECK_GDAL so it uses LIBS instead
	  of LDFLAGS.  This makes it more consistent with other usages.
	  gdal-config --libs actuall returns both LDFLAGS and LIBS type
	  information, and using its output for LDFLAGS winds up putting the
	  -lgdal flag very early in the link line.  This could be a problem on
	  some systems.

2005-08-06 18:05  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.31): Fix dumb mistake in the section that handles
	  the "gdal-config not found" condition.

2005-08-06 18:01  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.30), configure.ac (1.123): Make probe for gdal
	  use gdal-config if it can be found.

	  If gdal-config is in the user's path, use it to get LDFLAGS and
	  CPPFLAGS to help the probe for gdal.h and libgdal.a.  Otherwise, use
	  the current settings of LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS and hope they're found.

	  In doing this, I think I see that the probe XASTIR_CHECK_IMAGEMAGICK
	  has a few bugs in it.

2005-08-06 07:14  tvrusso

	* src/db.c (1.472): Fix new emergency processing in
	  decode_ax25_line so that it only attempts to work on valid packets.
	  This was causing segfaults at strcmp(my_callsign,call_sign) when
	  connecting to an internet server (upon receiving the # javAPRServ
	  line), because call_sign was NULL.

2005-08-06 01:14  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.6): Making the output a bit easier to
	  understand.

2005-08-05 03:13  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.70): Using font metrics to determine size
	  of font.  We then use that to determine the size for the black
	  rectangle underneath the font.

2005-08-04 19:34  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.471), src/draw_symbols.h (1.19), src/draw_symbols.c
	  (1.69): Drawing a line between the waypoint symbol and the
	  station that originated it.  Per the spec.

2005-08-04 01:52  we7u

	* symbols/symbols.dat (1.24): Updating a symbol or three.

	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.179), src/interface.c (1.225),
	  src/main.c (1.592), src/main.h (1.82): Have implemented an
	  EMERGENCY BEACON transmit capability.  Look for it under the "Help"
	  menu (appropriate, no?).

2005-08-03 19:15  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.5): More minor cleanups.  No real changes.

2005-08-03 19:01  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.470): Added emergency beacon decode for the string
	  "EMERGENCY" anywhere in the packet, plus the strings:
	      ALARM
	      ALERT
	      WARNING
	      WXALARM
	      EM If seen in the TO: field of the packet.  This matches the
	  decoding provided by APRS+SA for this feature.

2005-08-02 20:22  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.4): Small tweaks to improve the output and
	  give us info while it is running instead of all the output at the
	  end.

2005-08-02 04:40  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.3): Changing the order of the individual flag
	  tests to match the summary output order from "configure".

	  digipeat? label.

2005-08-02 04:16  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.2): Fiximg the grep at the end.

2005-08-02 02:33  we7u

	* REGRESSION_TESTS (1.1): Initial checkin.  A "dumb" script the way
	  it is currently written, but it could be made much more intelligent
	  over time, and extended to perform more tests.

2005-08-02 02:29  we7u

	* symbols/symbols.dat (1.23): Changing the symbols to be more
	  spec-compliant.  The spec keeps changing on us.  Added an SUV
	  symbol.  Moved the Shelter symbol to the secondary table.  Changed
	  the background on the Storm Watch symbol to orange instead of red.
	  Still need to do the waypoint symbol so it is a red circle and have
	  a line going between it and the mobile transmitting it, plus need to
	  change "No Sym Yet" to a circle with a slash through it, per the
	  latest spec addendum.  It would be worth taking a look at all the
	  symbols to verify compliance.

2005-08-02 02:26  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.57): Getting rid of a compiler warning (unused
	  variable) when ImageMagick isn't compiled in.

2005-08-01 22:08  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c (1.100): Move declaration of draw_filled out of

	  (1.21), src/messages_gui.c (1.43), src/wx_gui.c (1.38): Adding
	  new capability to the Map Feature Search function:  Now returns a
	  chooser dialog that allows seeing up to the first fifty matches for
	  the search, then centering the map on any of them.  Also tweaked
	  array sizes throughout the code used for sending parameters to X11
	  calls.

2005-07-29 19:32  we7u

	* src/locate_gui.c (1.17), src/map_gnis.c (1.20), src/maps.h
	  (1.54): Changing locate_place() to gnis_locate_place() because it
	  is too similar to the function Locate_place().  Added some comments
	  w.r.t. putting in a chooser option for the Locate Map Feature
	  function.

2005-07-29 19:31  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.468): Changing some comments.  No code changes.

	  src/map_shp.c (1.99), src/map_tif.c (1.23), src/maps.c (1.436),
	  src/maps.h (1.53): Implement auto detection of USGS DRG topo maps
	  (the ones actually from USGS, with proper GeoTIFF tags).

	  Changed map driver interface to take a struct of map flags instead
	  of a single "draw_filled" integer.

	  Changed map properties to support setting of Yes/No/Auto for a given
	  map's "USGS DRG" field.  If Yes, the color map is assumed to be
	  USGS's and the color settings in Map->Configure USGS DRG are used.
	  If No, all colors in the colormap are displayed.  If Auto, the
	  tiff's Image Description tag is queried and if it begins with "USGS
	  DRG GeoTIFF" then it's as if the setting was Yes, and if it doesn't
	  (or the tag does not exist) then it is as if the setting was No.

	  Added rowcol to map properties dialog to handle the extra buttons
	  without widening the window.

	  Cleaned up the code in main.c that locates the filename in a map
	  properties line.  It was being done by hardcoding the offset in 8
	  places to 31.  Moved the magic number to a preprocessor symbol so it
	  only needs to be changed once now.  There has got to be a cleaner
	  way still, but that's enough for now.

	  Changed all map drivers to support the new map_data_flags struct
	  instead of the int draw_filled.

	  Changed language files.  Not sure I got all of them right.

2005-07-25 17:00  tvrusso

	* src/xa_config.c (1.136): Change DRG_COLORS settings so that they
	  default to ON if a config file is read in that doesn't contain the
	  settings.  This will make sure that users who upgrade don't get
	  surprised by having all their topo maps disappear upon upgrading.

	  various drawing colors on geoTIFF images.

2005-07-23 01:27  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c (1.21): Added a couple of defines at the top that
	  control whether we display an entire topo map or just the contours,
	  and which color we display them in.

2005-07-22 19:42  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.170): Cleaning up the curl code a bit more:

	  make the code much easier to maintain and extend.

2005-07-22 04:33  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.66): Adding a list of libraries for a full-up Xastir
	  compile on SuSE 9.0 to aid people in deciding which libraries might
	  be needed.

2005-07-21 02:19  we7u

	* src/map_cache.c (1.16), src/map_cache.h (1.7), src/main.c

2005-07-21 02:12  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c (1.38): Fixing the duration hours slider so that

	  successfully used with Xastir.

2005-07-20 05:13  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.99): Added an example of how to use the

	* src/main.h (1.81), src/db.c (1.467), src/xa_config.c (1.134):
	  Implementing user-configurable digipeater callsigns.  Users will now
	  be able to edit the comma-delimited string in their xastir.cnf file.
	  There are no GUI tie-ins for editing the string at this point.

2005-07-20 04:43  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.98): Adding some more detail about the

2005-07-18 18:12  tvrusso

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.68): Fix for broken DF directional lines

	  NRQ (or the default of 512 nautical miles.

2005-07-17 06:19  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.89): Allowing the passcode to be longer

	  allowed currently in the AGWPE code.

2005-07-17 06:17  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.36): Adding a #define and some #ifdef's that

2005-07-13 02:44  tvrusso

	* config/tgr2shppoly.dbfawk (1.8): Make polygon boundaries the same
	  color as fill.  Now that boundaries are no longer stippled the same
	  way as the fill, the black boundaries are too glaring.

2005-07-12 23:06  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c (1.98): Reset stipple style to solid when drawing
	  boundaries of polygons with dbfawk.  They were getting drawin in the
	  stipple pattern used for fill, which made for fuzzy boundaries.

2005-07-11 19:25  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.119): Fixing the Geotiff summary line so that it
	  says "no" if libproj isn't found.  It was blank until now in this
	  case.

2005-07-11 19:24  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.54): Moving one line so that this will compile
	  ok without warnings if no ImageMagick.

2005-07-11 17:50  we7u

	* src/xastir.h (1.44): If ImageMagick is not found, util.c compile
	  will fail without this change.

2005-07-11 14:55  tvrusso

	* src/main.c (1.581): Put use of map_cache_fetch_disable into the
	  same ifdef as the definition of that variable, so that people who
	  aren't using map caching can link.

2005-07-10 17:56  tvrusso

	* FAQ (1.57): Change question 5.4 to actually have "5.4" in its
	  title.

2005-07-10 15:37  tvrusso

	* scripts/Xastir_tigerpoly.py (1.5): Add -d flag to the Usage error
	  message.

2005-07-10 15:36  tvrusso

	* scripts/Xastir_tigerpoly.py (1.4): Add "-d" option to this script
	  to allow dissolution of common boundaries between polygons with the
	  same Landmark designation.

	  This is done by scanning all PolyChainLink records, checking that
	  both left and right polygon have associated AreaLandmark records,
	  and that both AreaLandmark records point to the same Land record.
	  If they do, then the two polygons are dissolved into one.

	  The option is not the default.

	  Using this option makes the output shapefile be topologically
	  inequivalent to the original TIGER/Line data, and as such they are
	  suitable only for display.  Distributing data produced in this
	  manner should be done with a prominient disclaimer pointing out that
	  the shapefiles are for display purposes, not serious GIS use.

	  Dissolving polygons in this way makes the TIGER data look much nicer
	  (but still pretty ugly) in xastir -- large landmarks no longer have
	  many copies of the labels, and no longer have ugly internal dashed
	  boundaries that mean nothing.

2005-07-09 03:30  we7u

	* src/dbfawk.c (1.27): A fix for the emacs temp-file bug that is
	  invoked by temp file symlinks of the form ".*.dbfawk" while editing
	  dbfawk files.  The code will now ignore anything but regular files,
	  and ignores directories and files that have a leading period.

	  (1.40): Enabling the reload maps (without cache) option on the
	  Map menu, with the back-end code in place to implement it.  A few
	  tweaks to the map_cache_del() function to return with error code
	  under certain conditions.

	* scripts/Xastir_tigerpoly.py (1.3): While trying to understand why
	  my TIGER polygon maps have so many identically-named small polygons,
	  I discovered an error in the Xastir_tigerpoly.py script that was
	  propagated from the original GDAL tigerpoly.py script.

	  The TIGER/Line format has a "Type I" record that links complete
	  chains (Type 1) to "GT-Polygons" through the "POLYIDL" and "POLYIDR"
	  attributes.  But according to the TIGER/Line documentation, a Type I
	  record that contains identical POLYIDL and POLYIDR attributes is a
	  line that is internal to a polygon, and should not be included in
	  its boundary.  The original tigerpoly.py script from which
	  Xastir_tigerpoly.py was derived simply added all lines with either
	  POLYIDL or POLYIDR to the boundary of polygon POLYID.  That means
	  that these internal points were not only incorrectly added to the
	  boundary of POLYID, they were added twice.

	  A simple test to throw away such "PolyChainLink" data (in the OGR
	  parlance, "Type I record" in the TIGER parlance) removes this
	  incorrect assembly of polygon boundaries.

	  This does *not* fix the issue of there being lots of tiny,
	  identically-named polygons in a given area (that's just how the data
	  is), but it DOES correct the "Error in computing fill/hole ring"
	  warnings I've been getting since forever, every time these
	  TIGER/Line-converted polygon shapefiles are loaded.  It also fixes
	  the problem I had trying to import these polygon shapefiles into
	  GRASS, which noticed and griped angrily about the topological
	  incorrectness of the data.

	  Unfortunately, taking advantage of this fix would require
	  regenerating all the TIGER polygon shapefiles that are up on
	  xastir.tamu.edu --- probably not worth the effort.  But should there
	  be a new round of corrected TIGER data that gets processed, the
	  script is now producing
	  (more) topologically correct shapefiles.

	  It might be a good idea to feed this back to Frank Warmerdam, on
	  whose tigerpoly.py script Xastir_tigerpoly.py was based.

	* src/maps.c (1.434): Undo bonehead commit by KM5VY (me).

	  I had mistakenly thought that "draw_filled" was a new map index
	  parameter, and tried to get the index_retrieve_from_file function to
	  set defaults for shapefiles differently.

	  This was an error, as draw_filled has always existed.

	  There is no way to "fix up" the index when running with new code --
	  the user is simply going to have to go through the map properties
	  and turn Auto on if he/she wants filled shapefiles to respect the
	  dbfawk file's settings.

	  The reason I thought the commit was right was that I was testing it
	  on an index that had been passed through awk to remove the
	  draw_filled variable.  It then inserted reasonable defaults, but
	  that's not the point.

	  It's unfortunate that a user with an existing batch of filled
	  shapefiles and dbfawk enabled will wind up surprised that they
	  stopped being filled, but that's the way it is.

	  There was a test of "draw_filled" to see if it was set to "auto",
	  but if it was, then draw_filled was changed to whatever the dbfawk
	  file "filled" value was.  Since that was always 0 or 1, it meant
	  that every shape after the first one would not have "draw_filled"
	  set to auto anymore, and the entire shapefile would be filled with
	  whatever that first shape's value was (on or off).

	  present.  The "Yes" (On) and "No" (Off) filled options that existed
	  before will now override a dbfawk file, so you can use a Shapefile
	  map in three different ways now from the Map Properties dialog.  I
	  use this "No" option for instance to make the NOAA Counties
	  Shapefile into a vector map so I can overlay it on top of a raster
	  map, use the "Yes" function to use it as a base map of the U.S., or
	  use the "Auto" function to get all the advanced per-object coloring
	  possible from the dbfawk file, including county names, border
	  colors, etc.

	  The default setting for new Shapefiles will be "Auto".  Default for
	  all other types of maps will be "No" or "Off".

2005-05-25 18:42  we7u

	* WMSRadar.geo (1.5), src/map_WMS.c (1.7): Moving the VERSION tag
	  into the .geo file.  Some servers are picky about this, so it can't
	  be hard-coded.

2005-05-24 19:49  we7u

	* src/map_WMS.c (1.6): Adding/changing some comments.

2005-05-24 19:21  we7u

	* src/map_WMS.c (1.5): Moving more of the WMS parameters into the
	  .geo file instead of hard-coding them.

2005-05-24 19:20  we7u

	* WMSRadar.geo (1.4): Moving more of the parameters into the .geo
	  file instead of hard-coding them.

2005-05-24 14:23  we7u

	* WMSRadar.geo (1.3): Getting rid of the county outlines in the
	  downloaded image.

2005-05-23 20:16  we7u

	* src/map_WMS.c (1.4): Corected some comments.  Turned off debug
	  output.

2005-05-23 19:59  we7u

	* WMSRadar.geo (1.2), src/map_WMS.c (1.3): Moving more of the
	  parameters into the .geo file instead of hard-coded (allows more
	  options to be specified via the .geo files).  Tweaked the scaling so
	  that the vertical scaling is correct now.

2005-05-23 19:30  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.162): Tweaking the lat/long string conversion
	  routines so they'll handle more input formats.

2005-05-20 14:33  we7u

	* src/map_WMS.c (1.2): Small tweaks to the URL generation for WMS
	  servers.  Map registration is not correct yet.

2005-05-19 15:43  we7u

	* src/.cvsignore (1.3): Adding "xastir" as well so that we won't
	  see that in the CVS status listings.  It's obviously a derived file.

2005-05-19 15:26  we7u

	* .cvsignore (1.2), callpass/.cvsignore (1.2), config/.cvsignore
	  (1.2), help/.cvsignore (1.2), m4/.cvsignore (1.2),
	  scripts/.cvsignore (1.2), src/.cvsignore (1.2),
	  src/rtree/.cvsignore (1.2), symbols/.cvsignore (1.2): Adding more
	  lines to the .cvsignore files in order to clean up CVS status
	  listings.

2005-05-19 15:01  we7u

	* Makefile.am (1.32), WMSRadar.geo (1.1), src/Makefile.am (1.28),
	  src/main.h (1.76), src/map_WMS.c (1.1), src/map_geo.c (1.45):
	  Adding initial support for WMS map formats.  This is not complete
	  yet, but the functionality is enough to give a taste for what is
	  possible in the near future.  Registration is still a bit off plus
	  we need to add methods for the user to specify layers desired,
	  specifying WMS servers from the GUI, etc.

2005-05-18 19:24  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.47): Modified parsing of GPGGA and GPRMC NMEA
	  sentences to handle more variations in the sentence structure.

2005-05-18 19:23  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.456): Changing some comments and debug statements
	  having to do with GPGGA and GPRMC NMEA sentence parsing.

2005-05-18 16:41  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.46): Tweak to the GPGGA parsing to allow a '3' for
	  GPS fix quality.

2005-05-17 20:41  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.161): I've had this patch around for a couple of
	  weeks.  It should allow matching on non-numeric SSID's for messaging
	  now, such as "WHO-IS" and "AE5PL-EM", which are the two test cases
	  that broke messaging earlier.  It has not been fully tested on RF
	  yet, but appears to work when directly on the internet feeds.

2005-05-09 17:09  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.117), help/help-English.dat (1.95): Setting up
	  for further CVS development of Xastir.  Changing rev to 1.5.1 to
	  differentiate it from the 1.5.0 stable release.  Added a new "What's
	  New in Xastir BETA" section to the help-English.dat file.

2005-05-09 16:34  we7u

	* README.Contributing (1.3), README.Getting-Started (1.18),
	  configure.ac (1.116), help/help-English.dat (1.94): Updating for
	  soon to be done 1.5.0 release.

2005-05-09 16:32  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.455): Spelling fix in comment.  No code changes.

2005-05-06 20:59  we7u

	* src/awk.c (1.27): Another tweak by by John Laxson, KC0PZN.  This
	  one fixes something that I messed up when I incorporated his first
	  patch.

2005-05-05 19:36  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.221): Changed one comment.  No code changes.

2005-05-05 19:23  we7u

	* src/awk.c (1.26): Tweak by John Laxson, KC0PZN, to speed up
	  dbfawk on MacOSX.  Thanks!

2005-05-05 19:19  we7u

	* README (1.23): Getting rid of version number where it's not
	  needed.  Will save us some work in the future.

2005-04-29 22:06  kd6zwr

	* src/interface.c (1.220): Fixes for segmentation faults on
	  Solaris.  Sending a NULL pointer to a %s argument to any of the
	  *printf() functions (actually strlen() inside it) causes the fault.
	  This patch intializes two vars to "" instead of NULL, {Which is
	  OK!!} protects a function by whacking NULLs into ""s, and moves a
	  debug printf below a NULL check.

2005-04-26 18:24  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.219): If an interface goes down due to a
	  connection being lost or inactivity, the 1st check_ports() call will
	  bring it back up now.  Previously it would wait for the 2nd
	  check_ports() call before bringing it back up.

2005-04-25 19:44  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.58): Added a paragraph about splitting large
	  Shapefiles into tiles.

2005-04-25 19:44  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.17): Minor changes to a couple of
	  sentences.

2005-04-19 17:39  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c (1.37): Fix by David Flood, kd7myc.  Turns of
	  TrackMe button if you leave tracking on but change the call being
	  tracked via the menus.  Thanks!

2005-04-18 04:31  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat (1.93): Updated the "what's new",
	  shamelessly ripping parts of curt's release notes because I'm behind
	  in keeping up with CVS. :-P

2005-04-15 17:42  we7u

	* xastir.spec.in (1.22): Adding a few more docs to the doc list.

2005-04-15 17:02  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.218), src/interface.h (1.31),
	  src/interface_gui.c (1.88), src/xa_config.c (1.132): Changes by
	  Andreas Bier, DL1HRC, to allow setting a tnc2multi into KISS mode
	  via a togglebutton on the interface dialog.  We can probably extend
	  this later to put other types of TNC's into KISS mode and/or to take
	  them out of KISS mode when shutting down the interface.

	  I also changed the default for new interfaces to have RELAY/WIDE1-1
	  digipeat turned off.

2005-04-15 16:30  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.16): Adding more notes about the
	  2nd-tier servers.

2005-04-14 18:31  we7u

	* Makefile.am (1.31): Adding the new doc into the Makefile

	  developers.

2005-04-13 15:50  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.160): Fixing a path check problem.  It wasn't
	  verifying that the char before the '-' was a digit before applying
	  N-n checks to the callsign.

2005-04-13 04:12  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.15): Pointing to a list of 2nd-tier

	  files.

2005-04-11 19:51  we7u

	* FAQ (1.51), README.Getting-Started (1.14): Updating the path
	  discussions to cover the new scheme (WIDE1-1 instead of RELAY).

2005-04-06 19:26  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.454), src/util.c (1.159): Making the "RELAY" digipeat
	  work with either RELAY or WIDE1-1, per the latest APRSSIG
	  recommendations on how to do paths and digipeating.

2005-04-06 17:03  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.158): Allowing WIDE1-1 as a RELAY type of callsign
	  per the new paradism.

2005-03-31 20:43  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.453), src/util.c (1.157): Fixes to make the new
	  WHO-IS server work with Xastir.

2005-03-30 17:12  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.44), src/map_tiger.c (1.30), src/util.c (1.156):
	  Changing text of one type of error message.

2005-03-26 06:33  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.57): Added a note about a blemish in the Haversine
	  formula we use for distance calculation.

2005-03-25 20:53  we7u

	* scripts/permutations.pl (1.9): Changes to the
	  comments/description.

2005-03-25 20:26  we7u

	* src/datum.h (1.12): Changing some comments.

2005-03-25 17:06  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.56): Added a summary regarding our
	  distance/angle/area calculations.

2005-03-24 20:25  we7u

	* src/datum.h (1.11), src/main.c (1.568), src/util.c (1.155):
	  Switching to Gerry-recommended Earth radii plus putting them into
	  central defines in datum.h.  That makes them easier to update in the
	  future.

2005-03-24 06:05  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.567): Converting the Measure function from
	  calculating area via planar geometry to computing it using spherical
	  calculations.  It should be much closer to reality now, particularly
	  as one zooms out.

2005-03-24 05:57  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.154): Changing some comments.

2005-03-24 05:51  we7u

	* src/util.h (1.34): Making a couple of routines available to other
	  modules.

2005-03-23 20:36  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.153): Converting the distance calculations from
	  using the Law of Cosines for Spherical Geometry to using the
	  Haversine Formula.  This should be more accurate for shorter
	  distances, no real change for longer distances.

2005-03-23 17:33  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.566): Bumping the check interval for inactivity
	  from 1 minute to 5 minutes.  This means that if we lose an internet
	  connection we might not get it back for between 10 to 15 minutes
	  (instead of the current 2 to 3 minutes), but it also means that
	  server connections won't bounce up and down as much if there are few
	  packets coming down the pipe.  One packet every 5 minutes is enough
	  to keep the connection going.

2005-03-22 23:10  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.152): Changed some comments.

2005-03-22 21:11  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.66): Added/changed some comments.

2005-03-22 20:38  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.13): Added an enumeration of the

2005-03-22 04:57  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.14), src/db.c (1.452), src/draw_symbols.c
	  (1.65): Fixes for DF objects to make the beamwidths and angles
	  correct.  Also fixed the "Unusable" beamwidth so that it still
	  appears as a DF object in the Object->Modify dialog.

2005-03-21 00:33  tvrusso

	* src/testawk.c (1.21): Add initializer for pattern, add variable
	  for label_color, and add appropriate code so that dbfawk files that
	  set label_color can be tested.

2005-03-18 21:20  we7u

	  (1.451): Fixing decoding of compressed DF beam objects/items.
	  Fixing the display in Station Info of DF stations.

2005-03-18 20:09  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.450), src/main.c (1.565): Fixes for varying
	  truncation on object/item comments.  We were allowing comments that
	  were longer than 43 chars, which were truncated during later
	  transmits by check_and_transmit_objects_items().  We now no longer
	  allow the extra length packets to be transmitted.  The spaces that
	  were added for Pmin/Pmax are now no longer added: that was another
	  cause for the varying truncation of the comment.

	  Fixed the object/item transmit routines so that we can now send
	  compressed-mode for all types.  The decode routines now have to
	  catch up.

2005-03-17 21:16  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.449): Better implmentation of my debug tweak that
	  will work with more compilers.

2005-03-17 21:07  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.448): Removing some comments.

2005-03-17 20:30  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.64): More work on dead-reckoning to
	  position the ghost symbols and the dashed lines correctly.  Have
	  disabled the arcs for now as the positioning is not correct for them
	  with the current code.

2005-03-17 20:28  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.150): Added poor-man's rounding to the places we
	  construct the transmitted lat/long's.  This helps with
	  dead-reckoning of symbols at close-in zoom levels.

2005-03-17 20:27  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.447): Added a define and some ifndef's to make some
	  debug easier.

2005-03-17 15:34  we7u

2005-03-16 20:15  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.87), src/db.c (1.446): Checking the return codes
	  of scanf/sscanf/fscanf functions.

2005-03-16 19:34  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.148): A workaround for an sscanf() bug that shows
	  up on Cygwin.  It wasn't parsing the lat/long properly in
	  compress_posit().  Re-coded the routine to do everything manually.
	  The other 60 or so places that scanf() and it's variants are used
	  should also be checked for correct operation on Cygwin.

2005-03-16 00:50  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.147): Fix for incorrect compressed packets on
	  Cygwin.  Evidently the 'N' in the latitude is getting passed to the
	  routine as an 'n', which causes the problem.  The root cause of the
	  problem is probably that the latitude variable is getting messed up
	  sometime earlier.

2005-03-15 19:25  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.48): Tweaks for Davis WX station by Clay Jackson,

2005-03-14 21:15  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.11), src/db.c (1.444), src/main.c (1.563):
	  Fixing a bug that crept in while coding some object/item stuff.
	  Moving some comments to a more appropriate place.  Commenting out
	  the last_modified_time variable for now, as it's not actually
	  implemented in the dead-reckoning code yet.

2005-03-14 03:11  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.10), src/db.c (1.443), src/main.c (1.562):
	  Dead-reckoning of objects and items:  Working a bit better with this
	  version.  We now use the latest DR'ed position when making a change
	  to the object/item.  Moving a DR'ed object/item works.  One thing
	  that doesn't work now is trying to update the position of a moving
	  object/item using the Modify dialog:  The lat/long boxes are ignored
	  now in favor of the DR'ed position.  Also note that the on-screen DR
	  function is a bit off in speed and direction from the more accurate
	  function that actually moves the object along.  This is yet to be
	  fixed.

2005-03-12 06:38  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.442): Dead-reckoning for compressed objects/items as
	  well.

2005-03-12 06:10  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.441): Better accuracy for the angle calculations for
	  object dead-reckoning.

2005-03-12 05:19  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.440): Transmitting dead-reckoned object/item
	  positions is starting to work in this version.  More to do yet, but
	  it could be useful as-is.

2005-03-11 16:45  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.439): Commenting out the code that moves
	  dead-reckoned objects.  Not correct yet.

2005-03-11 15:52  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.438): Initial version of dead-reckoning for objects.
	  Dead-reckoned positions are transmitted now at the decaying transmit
	  interval.  Still need to do more work on this, like computing the
	  latest dead-reckoned position and transmitting that position at the
	  point an object/item is changed, correcting the disparity between
	  the on-screen DR and the transmitted DR (on-screen DR appears to
	  compute angle based on screen pixels, while the transmitted DR
	  computes angle based on lat/long).  The log file is ignored in these
	  changes also:  If Xastir crashes or is shut down, time for the DR
	  object will be lost and it will start DR'ing at the point it was
	  last transmitted at before shutdown.

2005-03-10 21:02  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.9), src/db.c (1.437), src/main.c (1.561):
	  Preliminary work for fixing dead-reckoning of objects/items.  More
	  to do yet, but this last_modified_time variable is needed to get
	  started on the problem.

2005-03-08 21:05  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.560): Mods by Dan Brown, N8YSZ.  Prevent multiple
	  Xastir's from getting run by a single user.  The prevents config

2005-03-02 16:56  tvrusso

	* src/map_tif.c (1.17): Comment out warning when a geotiff file has
	  no PCS.

	  Geotiffs without PCS (Projected Coordinate System) tags are assumed
	  to be lat/lon rasters.  Now that this capability is being more
	  widely used, especially by users outside the US, this warning is
	  just an annoyance.  It was only there because it was once cause to
	  reject a raster if it had no PCS.

2005-03-01 20:55  we7u

	* src/igate.c (1.45): Allowing nws-stations.txt changes to take
	  effect right away for stations being gated to RF.  If the file has
	  been changed, the in-memory database gets updated.

2005-03-01 20:32  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.559): Allow re-creating of an object or item that
	  has been killed and is still in the database.  Previous code
	  wouldn't allow that and brought up a warning popup.  Now the popup
	  happens only if a "live" object/item is in the database with the
	  same name.

2005-03-01 20:05  we7u

	* src/igate.h (1.7), src/db.c (1.436), src/igate.c (1.44): Igating
	  of specific objects/items to RF is now possible by listing the
	  object or item name in data/nws-stations.txt.  The listing is
	  case-insensitive.  Putting a wild-card source callsign in that file
	  doesn't get objects/items from that station igated to RF, but other
	  packets from that callsign do get gated.  Objects/items have to be
	  specifically listed by name, as the code stands now.

2005-03-01 19:36  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.435): Proper RF gating of objects/items when the
	  originating callsign is specified in the data/nws-stations.txt file.
	  The previous code was incorrect w.r.t. object/item gating.

2005-03-01 17:09  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.434), src/igate.c (1.43): Initial attempt at gating
	  individual stations through to RF, if those stations are spelled out
	  in the data/nws-stations.txt file.  Wildcarding is inherent, so
	  "we7u" will match "we7u", "we7ua", and "we7uaa" through "we7uzz".
	  This change also means that any packets (like posits perhaps) from
	  an NWS station that are not weather alerts will now get gated to RF.
	  Hopefully this won't be a problem.  I've left an fprintf() in the
	  code so you'll see which new packets are gated through to RF (prints
	  to STDERR).  We'll remove that fprintf() later once we're satisfied
	  with the new operation.

	  old.

2005-02-17 09:14  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.146): Better version of the function which checks
	  the unproto paths as they are entered by the user.  This one checks
	  for all the proper relations between the n-N numbers, and limits
	  them to MAX_WIDES (which is set in util.h).

2005-02-16 23:20  tvrusso

	* src/util.c (1.145): Repair check_unproto_path to fix mistakes I'd
	  made in last commit (atoi() on a character rather than string), and
	  rearrange things so that some odd usages in the original code still
	  work.

	  I have not cleaned it up properly.  Instances of changing character
	  pointers in a conditional remain as they were in original code, and
	  flagging "bad" paths like "WIDE1-2" results in "Path too long" error
	  message when it should say instead "very strange path".  But it will
	  NOT reject paths like WIDE2-1 anymore, and will accept paths like
	  WIDE7-2 (even though the first digit is essentially meaningless when
	  used this way).

	  This time I actually tested these fixes and they work.

2005-02-16 21:38  tvrusso

	* src/util.c (1.144): Simple change to stop "WIDEN-n" where N!=n
	  being flagged as a "Bad Path"

	  Instead, it now checks that N>=n, and only reports "N<n" as a bad
	  path.

	  The "N!=n is bad" has been there since October 2004, when the
	  path-checking code was first added.

	  This addresses comment raised on xastir mailing list on 16 Feb 2005.

2005-01-26 21:36  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.143): Fix for bug pointed out by Tapio Sokura.  We

	  the Display Packet Data dialog, one per interface which has transmit
	  enabled and is active.  This allows the user to see the paths being
	  used for each transmit for each interface.  The transmit string used
	  to show a generic path before, plus would appear in that dialog
	  whether any interfaces were up/transmit enabled.  Also, if transmit
	  objects was disabled, the dialog used to show a transmit as if
	  something went out.  This has been fixed.  Minor problems remain
	  such as a "(null)" as a path for x-spider interface transmits.
	  Perhaps other interfaces might have the similar problems.

	* src/map_gnis.c (1.17): Add check that latitude and longitude

	  This fixes the bogus bounding box problem that was leading to xastir
	  loading gnis files that should have been out of view.  It had been

	* src/map_shp.c (1.90): Add additional cases for switch statement
	  to allow 3D point and polygon files to be recognized and displayed.
	  All these do is let the 3D versions be treated by the same code as
	  the 2D versions --- the Z coordinate is simply ignored.

	  If xastir ever becomes a 3D-rendering APRS code these cases could be
	  handled differently.

	  I have no instances of 3D point or polygon shapefiles, so did not
	  test these changes.  The 3D polyline cases I have do display
	  properly.

2005-01-09 23:10  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c (1.89): Add two tiny changes that allow 3-D
	  polyline shapefiles to be displayed.

	  All this does is allow xastir to recognize 3D polyline shapefiles
	  (SHPT_ARCZ) and display them as if they were 2-D (by ignoring all
	  but the X and Y coordinates).  The finnish shapefiles that were
	  causing the crash fixed by the previous commit were 3D shapefiles
	  that can now be displayed without first being converted to 2D with
	  ogr2ogr.

2005-01-09 23:06  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c (1.88), src/shp_hash.c (1.10): map_shp.c:  move
	  block of code that accesses rtrees and shapefile hashes to after the
	  block that includes the "return if just indexing".  This lets us
	  skip the hashtable lookup and rtree generation for maps that are
	  merely being index.

	  shp_hash.c: add a test before RTreeInsertRect to make sure that the
	  bounding box being passed is valid (i.e. that it won't fail the
	  assertion inside the RTreeInsertRect routine), and skip the shape if
	  not.

	  This should fix the crashes Curt was seeing a few days ago when
	  including some defective Finland shapefiles in his map directory.

	    unconditional distribution of the directory.

	    fix SOURCES line in src/rtree/Makefile.am to reference only files

	  hasn't specified --with-rtree.  If it fails to build Makefile.in in
	  the rtree directory then a different solution (perhaps changing
	  configure.ac so it doesn't try to generate src/rtree/Makefile) is
	  needed.

	  generates the Makefile.in in the rtree directory.

	  we're sending.  Only one copy of the outgoing data is shown, no
	  matter how many ports we have open, and the path that is shown is

	  (1.9), config/nwsw_ddmmyy.dbfawk (1.9), config/nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk
	  (1.11), src/map_shp.c (1.86): Change all dbfawk files for NWS
	  county/zone shapefiles so the display_level is very high.

	  Until last week or so, display_level was always ignored for polygon
	  shapefiles, so this didn't matter.  Now that draw_shapefile_map
	  actually uses the parameter for these it becomes important that the
	  value be big enough to display such shapefiles at reasonable zooms.

	  map_shp.c: change display_level in default dbfawk rule (the one used
	  when no dbfawk file is found) to have display_level=65536.  This
	  means that a shapefile for which no dbfawk file is found will always
	  have all of its lines and polygons displayed at almost all zoom
	  levels, unless the user disables display of that shapefile using map
	  properties min/max zoom parameters.

2004-12-26 21:13  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.421), src/messages.c (1.49): More tweaks to the

	  too close together time-wise in the queue and refuse to queue them
	  up.  We don't want to send too many ack's all together and trash the
	  channel.

2004-12-26 18:57  tvrusso

	* src/map_shp.c (1.85), src/maps.c (1.425): Add facility to purge

	  number of seconds out.  We now use this to schedule ack's at t+30,
	  t+60, and t+90 seconds if we find that we're getting duplicate
	  messages from a station we're conversing with.

2004-12-24 23:28  we7u

2004-12-24 20:27  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.417): There _are_ code changes in this commit.  This
	  tweak gets rid of the constantly popping-up Send Message dialogs
	  when you're doing messaging.  If you start a QSO and then close the
	  dialog, it should pop up again on the FIRST ACK that you receive, on
	  a TIMEOUT of the message, or on the FIRST INSTANCE OF A NEW MESSAGE
	  from the other party.

	  add test to get_path_data to make sure it never tries to use a null
	  pointer in xastir_snprintf.  It is now possible for xastir to leave
	  a path null when it receives a posit or message via RF that has been
	  gated to RF from an Igate.  Until that's fixed, it's important not
	  to try to dereference the null pointer.

	  shp_hash.c add standard xastir header comments.

2004-12-24 08:50  tvrusso

	* src/hashtable_itr.c (1.4), src/shp_hash.c (1.7): Re-insert line I
	  accidentally deleted along with debugging cruft, comment out line
	  that declared variable only used in debugging to silence warnings.

2004-12-24 07:39  tvrusso

	* src/hashtable_itr.c (1.3), src/hashtable_itr.h (1.2),
	  src/shp_hash.c (1.6): For-sure fix of segfaults in the new
	  "decaying rtree" stuff.

	  Turns out that the hashtable_iterator code has some built-in
	  assumptions that we'll never actually have an empty hashtable.  The
	  hashtable_iterator_value routine always dereferenced the entry it
	  pointed to, even though hashtable_iterator sets that to null if the
	  table's empty.

	  Rather than insert code all over the place that tests the internals
	  of the iterator structure, I've hacked on the hashtable_iterator
	  code to return null if it was asked for nonsense, and tests for null
	  pointers before dereferencing.

	  Also, the hashtable_itr.h file defined inline versions of the
	  hashtable_iterator_key and hashtable_iterator_value functions even
	  though hashtable_iterator.c defined them as regular functions.  This
	  was a source of much additional baldness when trying to debug until
	  I realized it.  Ifdef'd those out.

2004-12-24 07:19  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.416): Getting rid of the multiple audio alerts or
	  speech alerts upon receipt of a message.  Should only alert on the
	  first copy of each now.

2004-12-24 05:51  we7u

	* src/messages.h (1.11), src/messages_gui.c (1.33): In the Send
	  Message dialog:  Moving the reverse path test into its own
	  uneditable text field.  It is too problematic trying to use it by
	  default for messaging, but it's a useful reference for choosing the
	  outgoing custom path for the QSO.

	* src/map_shp.c (1.84), src/shp_hash.c (1.5): Add check for
	  hashtable iterator being null before using it.  If we've been idle
	  for a long time then it could be the case that the entire
	  hashtable's been purged and so this test is necessary.  I think this

	  after several hours of unattended operation.

2004-12-23 07:54  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c (1.25): Changing the format of messages in

	* src/map_shp.c (1.83): Fix for a logic mistake I introduced last

	  This might be the source of the unpredictable segfaults I'm seeing
	  at random times hours apart.  If not, I'll get that one pinned down
	  ASAP.  This was still a mistake, even if it's not the source of

2004-12-22 22:49  we7u

2004-12-22 07:18  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.413): Changes to Group Messages/Queries so that
	  multi-line messages will show in the dialog, and so that messages

	  the dialog.

2004-12-22 06:48  tvrusso

	  src/maps.h (1.49), src/shp_hash.c (1.4), src/shp_hash.h (1.2),
	  src/rtree/node.c (1.3): Round of RTree usage optimizations.

	  1) If a shapefile's bounding box is entirely contained in the
	     current viewport, don't bother doing an RTreeSearch for visible
	     shapes --- just read the file sequentially.  Don't even bother
	  accessing the hash table for the file.

	  2) Store a time stamp every time a shapefiles hash table entry is
	  accessed.

	  3) Every hour, walk through the hash table and purge records that
	     have not been accessed in 1 hour.  (this needs to become a
	  configurable time)

	  This should improve memory usage for a few special use cases, and
	  free up RAM wasted on shapefiles that are not really going to
	  benefit from having the RTree fast lookup.

	  I've not run this for long times to see how the memory usage behaves
	  --- once the RTree is allocated and freed, the processes resident
	  size doesn't seem to drop down, but it does make the space that was
	  freed available for indexing a different shapefile.

	  There are probably many ways to make this even more flexible and
	  automatically adaptive to the users' usage patterns.  This should be
	  a good start, though.

2004-12-22 03:23  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.411): Another tweak to the ST_DIRECT stuff.  This
	  tweak causes us to overwrite the saved path only if 1) the current
	  packet is direct, 2) the ST_DIRECT path is not set, or 3) ST_DIRECT
	  is set but nothing has been heard direct for the last hour.  The end
	  result is that we should see the most recent directly-heard path in
	  Station Info, unless the station has not been heard direct for the
	  last hour, in which case we may see a digipeated path or an INET
	  path there.

	  before initialization, code was in place that would always set that
	  variable first.  But it was all in conditionals that gcc couldn't
	  possibly know were always true before any use of the variables.
	  Added initializers to shut it up.

	  (1.150), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.147),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.157), src/messages_gui.c (1.32):
	  Fixing transmit of messags so that the three illegal chars (per the
	  spec) cannot be transmitted.  We now substitute '.' for any of those
	  three, then alert the operator that we've done so via a popup
	  message.

2004-12-20 02:56  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.408): Added code to check for incorrect case in
	  queries and notify us.  This may be used to send a message back to
	  the originator asking them to please follow the APRS spec, or the
	  messages may be ignored.  They go to STDERR currently.  The same
	  code was added to the unimplemented query sections, but commented
	  out.

2004-12-19 08:44  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.407): Fixing the Station Info dialog so that it will
	  display stations in the Station Chooser dialog +/- 20 pixels in
	  either direction from the mouse pointer.

2004-12-19 01:08  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.33): Adding some returns in the case of a few
	  socket & pipe errors, to get the process to close and not waste CPU
	  on Cygwin.

2004-12-18 21:06  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.111), src/Makefile.am (1.23): Change configure
	  and makefiles so that if the user does not ask for rtree, the
	  library isn't even built and the -L/-l options aren't used.

	  Not doing this before was just laziness on my part.

2004-12-18 20:43  tvrusso

	* src/rtree/Makefile.in (1.2): Removing something that should not
	  have been committed --- Makefile.in is supposed to be created by
	  bootstrap.

2004-12-18 20:29  tvrusso

	* src/rtree/sources.htm (1.2): Fix up pointers to original source
	  code location and author's web site.

2004-12-18 07:51  we7u

	* src/shp_hash.c (1.2): Fixing up some #ifdef's for the shapefil.h

	  Experimental "RTree" spatial indexing feature.

	  To enable, use "--with-rtree" in configure.

	  Current implementation is very memory intensive, but speeds up
	  rendering of large shapefiles.  Needs further work.

	  without the "--with-rtree" option the code behaves as before, all
	  changes are ifdef'd out.

2004-12-17 04:36  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.31): Added a couple of test for a closed pipe
	  or socket.  Trying to solve an x_spider problem on Cygwin where we
	  get error messages at the server's STDERR when a client disconnects.

2004-12-16 20:40  tvrusso

	* src/db.c (1.406): Exclude own station from "DIRECTS" reply to
	  APRSD query.

2004-12-16 06:01  tvrusso

	* src/testawk.c (1.19): Minor tweaks to README.MAPS

	  Change testawk.c to remove a feature that uses command line args as
	  a dbfawk program literal --- this is why usages like
	    testawk foo.dbfawk foo.bar (a likely guess at usage) lead to
	  segfaults instead of helpful messages.  Change usage string to
	  reflect reality.

	  I hope nobody really used that feature, but it doesn't seem likely,
	  and it was definitely the case that the segfaults were confusing
	  users.

2004-12-16 05:29  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS (1.49), src/db.c (1.405): README.MAPS: add a little
	  explanation of how to use testawk (which has the habit of
	  segfaulting on commandlines it doesn't understand)

	  db.c:  An attempt to make APRSD (Direct Station Query) responses not
	  be limited to a single line when there are too many direct stations
	  to fit on that line.

	  I have not been able to test the db.c change yet, as I can't hear
	  more than 5 stations directly, so I have to commit this and wait
	  till my partner in crime in Albuquerque can get this update, rebuild
	  xastir, and run long enough to hear a few dozen direct stations so I
	  can query him.

2004-12-15 21:58  tvrusso

	* config/Makefile.am (1.20): Add 24kgrid.dbfawk to list of things
	  to install.

2004-12-15 17:56  tvrusso

	* config/24kgrid.dbfawk (1.1): Adding dbfawk for the 24kgrid
	  shapefile from geocomm.com.

2004-12-15 17:03  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.48): Added a pointer to the Canadian shapefile

2004-12-15 04:30  we7u

	* src/map_tiger.c (1.28): Moving the "Loading..." message to below
	  where the variable is initialized which it uses to print.

2004-12-14 21:26  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.47): Making the IMAGESIZE line requirements more

2004-12-14 20:17  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.5), src/db.c (1.404), src/main.c (1.547):
	  Adding interface numbers to the Incoming Data dialog.  "sp" for

	  for anything else.

2004-12-14 19:39  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.206): Fixing the double-header problem for
	  packets heading out port 2023.  Hopefully this is the last of it.

2004-12-14 16:01  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.81): Fix to prevent bringing up an
	  interface upon changing its properties.  Fix by Dan Brown, n8ysz.

2004-12-13 03:19  tvrusso

	* src/db.c (1.403): Change to look for message ID after *final* "{"
	  in a message rather than first.  This improves interoperability with
	  UI-View, which will ack a malformed message like:
	  KB7ZVA-1>APU25N,TCPIP*,qAC,KB7ZVA-1::KM5VY    :{Duh{76 (the first {
	  is technically illegal) by acking message 76, whereas prior to this
	  commit xastir would see the message ID as "Duh{7" and do:
	  KM5VY>APX142,TCPIP*::KB7ZVA-1 :ackDuh{7 causing UI-View to ack
	  message 7, and assorted other nonsense.

	  Tested only by having one instance of xastir send a malformed
	  message to another and seeing the ack of the real message ID.

2004-12-12 22:21  tvrusso

	* config/tgr2shppoly.dbfawk (1.5), src/map_shp.c (1.79): Make
	  polygon draws respect the "skip_it" step --- until now it was not
	  possible to use the dbfawk variable "display_level" to shut off
	  drawing specific polygons at large zooms.  Don't know why I hadn't
	  noticed that all that wasn't working.

	  Now that they're being paid attention to, had to tweak all the
	  display_levels in tgr2shppoly.dbfawk so things show up at reasonable
	  levels.

2004-12-10 02:35  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.109): Fixing the comment so that it is accurate.

2004-12-10 02:32  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.108): Adding a case statement for Cygwin that
	  will change "-O2" compiler flags to " ".  This should speed up
	  Cygwin compiling a great deal, at the expense of slightly larger,
	  more inefficent executables.

2004-12-09 20:27  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.55), README.Getting-Started (1.9), configure.ac
	  (1.107), update-xastir (1.7): Making --without-errorpopups be the
	  default.  Must add "--with-errorpopups" in order to get the previous
	  operation now.  Added some code to configure.ac to remove the "-g"
	  compiler option, so we'll get stripped executables by default now.

2004-12-08 16:57  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.44), src/interface_gui.c (1.80): Disabling the
	  time-set togglebutton when running Cygwin.

2004-12-08 14:58  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.546): Finally, a fix for the keyboard modifiers
	  problem, where any modifiers enabled will mess up the mouse menus.
	  The problem turned out to be a Motif 2.x function that doesn't work
	  properly with modifiers.  Switching to the Motif 1.x function that
	  accomplishes the same thing fixed it.

2004-12-08 05:45  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.41), src/map_tiger.c (1.27), src/util.c (1.135):

2004-12-07 19:39  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.40), src/map_tiger.c (1.26), src/util.c (1.134):
	  Adding some currently unused options for libcurl.  These are options
	  that were added recently, so only some libcurl versions have them.
	  They have to do with ftp and http proxying.

2004-12-07 18:48  we7u

	* FAQ (1.45): Changed the proxy note a bit.

2004-12-07 17:48  we7u

	* FAQ (1.44): Added instructions for getting through and http proxy
	  server.

2004-12-07 17:32  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.39), src/map_tiger.c (1.25), src/util.c (1.133):
	  Adding another libcurl option so that it can read the ~/.netrc file.
	  This is needed by those using http proxy servers so they can get
	  through the firewall.

2004-12-07 08:05  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.132), src/util.h (1.30): Added a new define to

2004-12-07 07:16  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.131): Fix to allow multiple specific callsigns in

	* src/interface.c (1.205), src/messages.c (1.45),
	  src/view_message_gui.c (1.24): Some HP/UX fixes by Dan Brown.

	  between the KISS frames.

2004-12-05 21:46  we7u

	* scripts/Makefile.am (1.16): Added get-gnis to the list.

2004-12-05 21:41  we7u

2004-12-01 19:45  we7u

	* src/messages.c (1.44), src/messages_gui.c (1.31): Added some
	  comments.  Fixed multi-line messages so that they appear correctly
	  in the Send Message dialog.

2004-12-01 04:34  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.4), src/db.c (1.402), src/messages.c (1.43):
	  Adding the tries counter to the Send Message dialog.

2004-11-30 22:59  tvrusso

	* config/tgr2shppoly.dbfawk (1.4): Another really minor tweak to
	  tiger polygon shapefile colorings.

	  Looks like there are no easily selected (by CFCC) city boundaries in
	  the files created by Xastir_tigerpoly.py, which makes it impossible
	  to color them with the current dbfawk file.  Gonna have to figure
	  that out.

2004-11-30 21:23  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.401): Variable-length non-highlighting for the
	  interval timer value.  Lets us keep the line as short as possible
	  yet still do the highlighting in the correct place (the message
	  text).

2004-11-30 21:12  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.3), src/db.c (1.400), src/messages.c (1.42):
	  Displaying the message timer interval in the Send Message dialog for
	  active messages.

2004-11-30 20:24  we7u

	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.156), src/messages.c (1.41),
	  src/messages.h (1.10), src/messages_gui.c (1.30): Updates to
	  messenging.  We can now see queued messages before they get to the
	  transmit stage.  New button added to kick the timer back to original
	  values (to get a QSO going again).  Timer value is currently sent to
	  STDERR, but will eventually be placed into the Send Message GUI as
	  well.

2004-11-30 18:43  tvrusso

	* config/tgr2shppoly.dbfawk (1.3), config/xastir.rgb (1.3),
	  src/color.h (1.8), src/main.c (1.545): changes to coloration of
	  shapefile tiger polygons.  Matches online colors a little better
	  now.

2004-11-30 06:56  we7u

	* src/map_tiger.c (1.24), src/map_cache.c (1.7), src/map_cache.h
	  (1.3): More map caching mods by Dan Brown, n8ysz.

2004-11-30 05:14  we7u

	* src/messages.c (1.40): Getting rid of extra message transmit
	  before timeout.  This causes us to transmit exactly MAX_TRIES times,
	  instead of MAX_TRIES + 1.

2004-11-29 20:55  we7u

	* src/database.h (1.2), src/db.c (1.399), src/messages.c (1.39):
	  Adding a "CANCELLED" indicator to the Send Message box for those
	  messages that made it to transmit from the queue but got manually
	  cancelled by the user.

2004-11-29 19:58  we7u

	* src/messages.h (1.9), src/messages.c (1.38): More RF-friendly
	  decaying algorithm for messages.  We start at 7 seconds and double
	  the interval each time.  Timeout occurs at about 2 hours if no ACK
	  received.

2004-11-29 19:37  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.30): Changing from LF to CRLF in lines sent to
	  clients which have connected to the server port.

2004-11-28 18:03  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.27): Change probe for db.h to use AC_TRY_COMPILE
	  instead of AC_CHECK_HEADER, so that we can apply the same usability
	  test that is present in map_cache.c.

2004-11-28 02:56  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.29): Making sure that lines sent out the server
	  port have "\r\n" at the end.  Before we just had '\r', which doesn't
	  correspond to the way the internet servers did it.

2004-11-26 06:10  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.111): Completing the GDAL/OGR library
	  instructions for Cygwin.

2004-11-26 01:35  we7u

	  compiling GDAL/OGR under Cygwin.

2004-11-23 17:19  we7u

2004-11-17 18:48  we7u

	* README (1.14): Added HP/UX instructions per Dan Brown, N8YSZ.
	  Current state of HP/UX port is:  Segfaults when connected to

2004-11-17 18:28  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.544): Fixing up a return that shouldn't pass back a

2004-11-17 17:57  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.543): Checking for map interrupts and returning,

2004-11-17 17:46  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.37), src/map_tiger.c (1.22), src/util.c (1.129):

2004-11-17 17:00  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.36): If ImageMagick is not found, we now refuse

	  99,999.

2004-11-16 22:50  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.106): Reversing the order of the map

2004-11-15 18:05  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.25): Fix of fix for fix of fix of probe for db
	  library.

	  Amounts to removing a comment character from a critical line that
	  I'd accidentally commented out.

	  Without this fix, building xastir on a machine without a db library
	  installed will fail with an error message at link stage about a
	  missing "-ldb".  That's because the configure script never reset the
	  LIBS variable after the probe.

2004-11-15 16:52  we7u

	* src/map_cache.c (1.6): Moving more of the includes inside the
	  #ifdef.  Including config.h so we get a direct answer as to whether
	  USE_MAP_CACHE is defined before we include anything else.

2004-11-15 16:22  we7u

	* src/map_cache.c (1.5): Moving a couple of includes below the
	  USE_MAP_CACHE #ifdef.  Makes it compile on systems that don't have
	  the map caching enabled.

2004-11-14 01:10  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.24):

	  Handful of changes to improve probe of db for map caching.

	  1) remove attempts to probe db version 3 libraries, coz the code
	     that uses db actually won't work unless the version is 4 or above.

	  2) make the probe stop probing when it finds a library that works.
	     Otherwise the probe keeps overwriting the "dblib" variable with
	  "no".

	  3) comment out the attempt to probe for db_open if db_create isn't
	     found.  That would only work if the code that uses db_create were
	     inside appropriate ifdefs, which was probably the case in the
	     package from which the autoconf macro was obtained.

	  4) Change the comment about "FreeBSD puts this in a weird place"
	     enough to give a reader an idea of where to look.

2004-11-14 00:54  we7u

	* src/map_cache.c (1.4): Moving the #ifdef below the #includes, so
	  that we have a chance of having the USE_MAP_CACHE variable be
	  defined.

2004-11-14 00:12  tvrusso

	* acinclude.m4 (1.23), configure.ac (1.105): A minor tweak to add
	  "Building with map caching.....: " to the list of things that are
	  printed out at the end of the configuration run.

2004-11-13 14:00  tvrusso

	* src/map_cache.c (1.3): Move the #endif for USE_MAP_CACHE to a
	  place where it actually takes out code that can't compile if
	  USE_MAP_CACHE isn't defined.

2004-11-13 00:40  shadow

	* acinclude.m4 (1.22): link against the real libdb we found; use
	  the header path for it we found

2004-11-13 00:17  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.102): Adding libdb and libdb-devel as necessary

	* README.win32 (1.101): Added info about NTFS "convert.exe" getting
	  run instead of ImageMagick's "convert.exe".  Added instructions
	  written up by Randy, KK6RW, regarding auto-starting Xastir.  William
	  McKeehan, KI4HDU, contributed to those instructions and was the
	  inspiration for them.

2004-11-12 18:52  we7u

	* src/map_cache.c (1.2), src/map_cache.h (1.2): Moving variables to

	  for maps to 6 months instead of one hour.

2004-11-12 18:47  we7u

	* src/map_tiger.c (1.20): Moving the variable declaration up to the

2004-11-12 18:24  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.21), src/Makefile.am (1.21): The final two pieces

2004-11-10 19:58  shadow

	* acinclude.m4 (1.19), configure.ac (1.103):

2004-11-02 15:19  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.126): Changing one variable so that it local to
	  where it is used instead of at the top of the routine.  Changed
	  flags to be counting flags instead of booleans, so we can later use
	  them to count digipeater types.  Added some comments.

2004-11-01 20:34  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.125): Tweaking the path-check code so that

2004-11-01 17:11  tvrusso

	* configure.ac (1.101), src/util.c (1.124): Add probe for strndup
	  to configure.ac.  Ifdef use of strndup in src/util.c.

	  strndup is a GNU extension and not portable to non-GNU systems.

	  strdup is portable, so is used if strndup isn't available.

2004-10-30 21:13  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.203), src/interface_gui.c (1.79): Adding path

	  Both of these libraries are now available directly through cygwin
	  setup, simplifying the installation.

2004-10-30 19:06  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.202): Adding the path check code into each
	  posit and object/item transmit, at the spot where the unproto path
	  is selected.  This probably needs to be added to the igate path code
	  as well.

2004-10-29 20:15  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.78): Another tweak by Ryan Butler, KB0JQO,

2004-10-29 15:53  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.126): Enabling tiger polygons for normal use.
	  Tweaked the code so that the polygon reassembly only gets done if we
	  have "filled" enabled for that map.

2004-10-29 14:53  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.125): Experimentally derived at better hash
	  sizes (twice the max size needed for any county in the state of WA).
	  Correct code now for free'ing the landmark hash.  Sped up the TLID
	  linked list code, but still testing that to make sure the polygons
	  are made correctly (it reverses the order that the line segments are
	  added to the geometryCollection).

2004-10-29 05:14  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.124): More tweaks to the tiger code.  Still not
	  enabled for general use.

2004-10-27 17:03  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.123): First working version of Tiger polygon
	  code.  #ifdef'ed out of the compile at present.

2004-10-27 17:02  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am (1.19): Adding the hashtable files.

2004-10-27 16:58  we7u

	  Adding generic hashtable functions.

2004-10-27 06:24  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.122): Starting to draw some filled polygons for
	  Tiger maps.  Still not ready for prime-time so the code is still
	  disabled by an #ifdef.

2004-10-27 05:44  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.121): More Tiger polygon code changes.  The
	  code is generating polygon geometries from the tiger data now, so
	  the next step is to start drawing them.

2004-10-27 02:55  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.120): Implementing hash functions for the Tiger
	  polygon code.  Still #ifdef'ed out, so it won't get compiled in
	  currently.

2004-10-24 03:38  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS (1.45): Mention the Xastir_tigerpoly.py script in the
	  place where this file previously said that shapefile conversion of
	  TIGER/Line data didn't contain polygon features.

2004-10-23 22:24  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.540): Fixing the segfault caused by closing the Map
	  labels font dialag before closing xfontsel.  Had to put in a couple
	  of "xfontsel_query = 0" statements in the callbacks for the Map
	  labels font dialog.

2004-10-22 15:25  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.119): Added some debug code.  It's not enabled
	  currently.

2004-10-22 02:54  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.118): Added much of the code needed to
	  reconstruct the Tiger polygons.  The new code is commented out right
	  now as it's not quite complete and it really slows things down as
	  well.  Optimization will happen AFTER the code is working.

2004-10-21 19:45  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.117): Changed some comments.

2004-10-21 19:28  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.116): Changed one variable name from i to ii
	  (easier to grep for).  Added some comments.

2004-10-21 08:55  tvrusso

	* config/tgr2shppoly.dbfawk (1.2): Don't display name of feature if
	  it is "None" (what some fields output by Xastir_tigerpoly.py get, a
	  feature inherited from tigerpoly.py -- haven't figured out why).

2004-10-21 08:51  tvrusso

	* config/Makefile.am (1.19), config/tgr2shppoly.dbfawk (1.1),
	  scripts/Makefile.am (1.15), scripts/Xastir_tigerpoly.py (1.1):
	  Add python/OGR script to generate polygon shapefiles from TIGER/Line
	  data.  Add dbfawk file to make them look less ugly than if there
	  weren't one.

	  Putting this in CVS merely to get it out there for community
	  hackage.

2004-10-21 04:19  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.115): Added some comments.

2004-10-20 21:30  we7u

	* src/geo-find.c (1.7), src/geocoder_gui.c (1.13): Find Address
	  works again.

2004-10-20 19:37  tvrusso

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.114): Fix mid-function declarations to allow
	  compilation by gcc 2.95.

2004-10-20 16:42  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.113): Changes to comments only.

2004-10-20 15:37  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.112): More messing with water layers.  Nothing
	  major.

2004-10-20 02:17  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.111): Commenting out the "Loading" message.

2004-10-20 01:13  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.110): Shapefiles are working again in GDAL.

2004-10-19 18:36  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.109): More color and line tweaks.  This change
	  probably disables Shapefiles, but SDTS and TIGER/Line files display
	  properly now.

2004-10-19 16:02  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.108): Moving all of the color code into the
	  guess_vector_attributes function.  Later we'll be able to convert
	  this function into our map preferences system once that is fully
	  defined.  Added color to the SDTS files.

2004-10-19 14:45  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.107): Faster determination of layer name.

2004-10-19 05:22  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.106): Starting to support proper color scheme
	  for SDTS-format maps.  At least have contours in yellow and other
	  layers in black now.

2004-10-19 04:08  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.105): Fixing OGR indexing so that the transform
	  is invoked every time.  Required for UTM/State-plane maps.

2004-10-18 20:17  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.420): Changing default Shapefile translator back to
	  Shapelib.

2004-10-18 20:09  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.104): Truncating the points better.  Was
	  truncating at 0 for negative values, which doesn't work.  We just
	  need to keep away from the +16000/-16000 points and greater, which
	  invoke X11 drawing bugs.  Truncating at zero creates dummy lines
	  along our top and left window borders.

2004-10-18 19:58  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.103): Very weak attempt at detecting
	  hypsography and hydropraphy SDTS files to decide to color them
	  yellow, keyed off "HY"or "HP" anywhere in the full filename (that's
	  why it is weak).  Other SDTS maps get colored black currently.

2004-10-18 18:57  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c (1.27), src/db.c (1.396), src/list_gui.c

	  src/view_message_gui.c (1.23), src/wx_gui.c (1.35),
	  src/xa_config.c (1.127): Changing the name of a global variable.
	  Tweaking elevation for SDTS contours so that they are in the correct
	  units.

2004-10-18 16:39  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.101): Outputting the correct label on
	  elevations now from SDTS files.  Later will try to switch it to
	  match the setting of the Enable English Units togglebutton so that
	  we can get a consistent display.

2004-10-18 14:55  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.100): Added some notes.  No code changes.

2004-10-16 04:25  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.99): Changing text from "ft" to "m" for
	  elevation.  SDTS file appear to have elevation in meters.  Also
	  changing back to yellow for the contour lines as it is highly
	  visible whereas the white/gray is not in many cases.

2004-10-15 19:24  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.98): Default coloring for raw Tiger/Line maps.

2004-10-15 16:27  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.97): Repositioning labels slightly.  Fixing
	  segfault caused by earlier "skip" option.

2004-10-15 15:36  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.96): Changing to lighter colors again for
	  contours and their labels.  They need to show up on top of
	  terraserver images.  Brown doesn't cut it.  Changed the contours to
	  gray80 and the labels to white.

2004-10-15 14:56  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.95): Changing to brown for the contours and
	  corresponding labels.  Closer to the USGS topo map colors.

2004-10-15 14:44  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.94): Drawing more labels along each object.
	  Tied to zoom level so that we reduce the quantity of labels as we
	  zoom out.

2004-10-15 14:22  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.93): Setting a few hard-coded default colors
	  from some types of map objects.  Later we'll redo this so that the
	  preferences come from a file.  Re-enabled code that dumps out the
	  layer information.  Added elevation display for SDTS-format DLG
	  contours.

2004-10-15 04:12  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.92): Several fixes.  Spatial filtering now
	  works properly.

2004-10-14 19:52  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.91): Simplified some of the code.  Have SDTS
	  contours working again, but have a problem with those files and
	  spatial filtering yet.  This version works but puts out error
	  messages to STDERR with SDTS files.

2004-10-14 06:05  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.90): Sped up GDAL maps:  Implemented the
	  spatial filtering mechanism inherent in the library.  We now filter
	  using our viewport as the bounding rectangle, which really speeds
	  things up as you zoom in.

2004-10-14 05:57  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.418): Fix for draw_vector function.  It now
	  rearranges the bottom/top/left/right if it's called with things out
	  of order, before calling map_visible.  This gets fewer vectors
	  rejected due to being off-screen/more vectors actually get drawn.

2004-10-12 15:34  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.89): Fixing up debug messages.  Sending weather
	  alerts off to the draw_shapefile_map function for now.

2004-10-12 02:11  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.88): Nicer labels for OGR plus rotation.

2004-10-11 20:12  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.87): Slight reformatting.  No code changes.

2004-10-11 20:06  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.86): Labels for OGR point files as well.
	  Untested.

2004-10-11 19:56  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.85): Initial labels for OGR vector maps.  Not
	  colored yet, not rotated, but better than nothing, which is what we
	  had before!

2004-10-11 19:15  tvrusso

	* src/map_tif.c (1.14): Add some error messages to the "geoTIFF
	  file not in proper format" block, so the user can see what is
	  actually wrong with the file.

2004-10-11 16:27  we7u

	* scripts/toporama250k.pl (1.4), scripts/toporama50k.pl (1.4):
	  Tweaking one comment that gets written out to the .geo files.

2004-10-10 19:16  tvrusso

	* src/testawk.c (1.18): Fix mistake in font_size output --- make
	  sure appears on correct line.

2004-10-10 19:01  tvrusso

	* src/testawk.c (1.17): Add "font_size" variable to those that are
	  read and output by testawk.  testawk still lags significantly behind

	  it has an effect on the generated makefile itself.  In this case,
	  dist-bzip2 adds a dist-bzip2 target to the makefile.

	  As far as I can tell, the folks who are having trouble with this
	  option are not in fact using automake 1.6.3 or later.  In ha2vr's

2004-09-19 23:39  tvrusso

	* README.MAPS (1.41), src/map_tif.c (1.12): This is a patch I've
	  been using for several months now: it allows xastir to use geotiff
	  files that are already unprojected lat/lon maps.  It simply checks
	  the "PCS" key in the geotif file, and if it's not there then the
	  file is assumed to be in lat/lon and can be used as is without
	  transformation.

	  It has no effect on maps that are not already in lat/lon, and so
	  will be invisible to anyone who hasn't needed the ability to read in
	  unprojected geotiff files.

	  README.MAPS updated to explain that gdalwarp can be used to convert
	  maps into lat/lon unprojected maps.  Also added a place to find
	  useful geotiff maps that need such conversion (FAA sectionals from
	  aviationtoolbox.org).

	  Tweaked the stuff on shapefile reprojection.  What was there were
	  verbose snippets from an email exchange between Curt and me.  Made
	  them a bit shorter and more to-the-point.

	  The importing of lat/lon geotiff files is significantly slower than
	  the importing of USGS quads, because the optimized reads that skip
	  over scanlines based on zoom level don't work.  I intended to figure
	  out how to make them work, but never did the work.  If folks start
	  using this a lot and get me to bump it up in priority I can revisit
	  it.

2004-09-19 22:50  tvrusso

	* config/Makefile.am (1.18), config/gps_wpt.dbfawk (1.1),
	  src/main.c (1.522): config:
	   New DBFAWK file for waypoints files downloaded through GPSMan.
	   Now, DBFAWK- enabled xastir will display names of waypoints next to
	   the symbol, no matter what directory they're put in.

	   Add gps_wpt.dbfawk file to makefile.

	  src:
	   make xastir write out a simple dbfawk file to go along with GPSMan
	   track and route shapefiles.  Prior to this, these files would only
	   display in the selected color if they were copied into
	   /usr/local/share/xastir/maps/GPS, and would display in all black if
	  they were anywhere else.

	  Unfortunately, because we have no control over the fields created by
	  GPSMan for these shapefiles, it is not possible to stick the color
	  itself into the dbf file, as Alan had suggested in various comments
	  in the code.

	  To use these new things:
	    for waypoints, do nothing -- the dbfawk file is generic and
	    applies to any GPSMan waypoint file.

	    For tracks and routes: Make sure to copy the dbfawk file when you
	     copy the shapefile and dbf file to a maps directory.  Xastir will
	  use it.

	    For tracks and routes downloaded prior to this patch: the dbfawk
	    file is simple, just copy one for a map of the same color.

	* src/maps.c (1.414): Speeding up the maps.c:index_retrieve()
	  function.  Making it more efficient.  Perhaps the next step would be
	  to turn it into a hash lookup, but that would require changing
	  perhaps several other routines to match.

2004-09-09 16:11  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.7): Adding another note about callpass.

2004-09-09 15:06  we7u

	  through profiling.

2004-09-08 19:22  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.47): Adding a section on checking for memory leaks.

2004-09-08 17:48  we7u

2004-09-07 21:40  we7u

	* FAQ (1.34): Added a bit about MacOSX USB adapters, courtesy of
	  Jeff Wigal, WY7Q.

2004-09-07 21:06  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.119): Changing format for time so that Cygwin can
	  understand more of it.  Tweak courtesy of Henk de Groot.

2004-09-07 17:15  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.6), README.win32 (1.99): Tweaking the
	  notes about GPSMan/gpsmanshp.

2004-09-07 15:39  we7u

	* src/festival.c (1.13): Adding some usleep() function calls for
	  the case where we can't open a socket to Festival, so that we don't
	  spin our wheels too fast trying to open sockets.

2004-09-07 04:06  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat (1.87): Done the body, just "whats new"
	  section left.

2004-09-07 01:44  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.517): Fixes for the Filled and Automaps columns in
	  Map Chooser->Properties dialog.

2004-09-05 06:24  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat (1.86): Updating helpfile some more, still
	  have last 1/3rd to go over and "whats new" section to write. FIXMEs
	  up for grabs; and if anyone otherwise wants to help let me know.

2004-09-03 15:16  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.381): Drawing symbol after we draw circles and other
	  items.  Trying to keep the text on top so that it is more readable.

2004-09-03 05:37  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.380): Moving the weather info to the top of the
	  Station Info dialog, for the cases where we have weather info
	  stored.  The weather info is the most important info for that
	  station in that case, so it should be readable without scrolling.
	  Stations without weather data are unaffected by this change.

2004-09-03 03:19  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.379): Fixed a small bug in positionless weather
	  decoding where it wasn't decoding course/speed fields.  We now take
	  another look for course/speed if either of them are empty.  Before
	  both of them had to be empty before we tried another type of parsing
	  for them.  Did the and->or conversion in several places in
	  extract_weather(), so the change affects more than just positionless
	  weather packets.

2004-09-02 20:58  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.149): Another tweak from Henk & Han.

2004-09-02 18:36  we7u

	* FAQ (1.33): Updating the locale-specific answers.

2004-09-02 17:45  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.516): Fixing the locale for numbers to "C".  We
	  require this in order to be able to write and parse our config files
	  and .geo files properly when the LC_NUMERIC or LANG environment
	  variables are set to something else.  This affects the printf and
	  scanf sorts of functions.

2004-09-02 14:49  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.515), src/xa_config.c (1.124): Bumping the max

	  are getting timeouts with it.

2004-09-01 19:34  we7u

	  Frigeri, IK0YUP.  Thanks!

2004-08-30 15:49  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.198): Adding a terminating zero to the AGWPE
	  packets in port_read() instead of in parse_agwpe_packet().

2004-08-30 15:28  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.197): Adding a string terminator to the end of
	  the AGWPE raw packets before we start processing them.  This keeps
	  portions of previously received packets from getting appended to our
	  current string during our processing.

2004-08-30 14:38  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.98): Changing to Henk de Groot's optimized
	  Festival install instructions.

2004-08-28 22:43  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.97): Added Festival instructions for Win32
	  courtesy of Tom Russo.  Thanks!

2004-08-27 20:09  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.514): Fix for high CPU-usage when time skips
	  backwards.  This fix causes Xastir to sleep a bit in the
	  UpdateTime() loop until time catches up again, thereby avoiding the
	  problem.  It also dumps a message out to STDERR as it goes into/out
	  of this mode.

2004-08-27 14:44  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.84): Changed the gdal output on startup to show
	  only those map formats that have been enabled in Xastir AND are
	  supported by the GDAL library that we're compiled against.

2004-08-27 14:16  we7u

	* config/language-German.sys (1.145): Tweaks by Rolf Bleher, DK7IN.
	  Thanks!

2004-08-27 01:07  shadow

	* configure.ac (1.95): update libgeotiff/libtiff/libproj configure
	  tests such that
	  1) libproj is checked for only once
	  2) libtiff is used if found when testing for libgeotiff

	  revised test from Tom Russo KM5VY and tested on MacOS X and Linux.

2004-08-26 21:03  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.377): Fixing the code so that snow can be parsed out

2004-08-23 19:48  we7u

	* README.Getting-Started (1.4): Added notes about where to look for
	  instructions for other OS'es.

2004-08-20 18:38  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.371): Fixing problem with truncated comment/status

	  now ghost the weather info (mostly) separately from posit info.  Got
	  rid of "<br>" from track logs read in from findu.com.  Fixed
	  realloc's in maps.c so that they won't cause a memory leak if they
	  fail.  Fixed Peet Bros. complete mode decoding so that the proper

	  barometric pressure reading for Peet Bros. complete mode parsing.

2004-08-18 00:17  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.508): Changed formatting, added comments.  No code

2004-08-17 16:41  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.39): Fix for 3-hour barometer with Peet U2000 in

	  so far it looks good.

2004-08-17 00:51  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.364): Fixing the "Move" function so that you can
	  drag/drop objects/items that are right on top of each other.  The
	  selection dialog will pop up so you can choose which one to move.

2004-08-14 16:43  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.507): Fixing object/item generation so that a space
	  is prefixed to the comment field only in the case where multipoint
	  polygons are present.  The space is necessary in order to parse
	  multipoint objects properly, but is not desired for other
	  objects/items where it would limit the extent of the comment.

2004-08-13 00:26  we7u

	* src/map_gnis.c (1.9): Update to GNIS search code for new

2004-08-13 00:25  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.45), README.MAPS (1.40), help/help-English.dat (1.82):
	  Updates to the docs to match new RINO, Server Port, and other
	  interface changes that were done recently.

2004-08-12 20:46  kd6zwr

	* src/x_spider.c (1.20): Moved some declarations up to the top of

	  gcc 2.96 under linux).

2004-08-12 20:00  we7u

	* src/map_gnis.c (1.8): Updating the GNIS map code to handle the

	  search code, but the display code appears to work fine now.

2004-08-12 17:03  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.191): Added some debug code for tracking down
	  errant raw packets in the AGWPE code.

2004-08-11 20:15  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.506): A bit of reformatting, plus sending to the
	  x_spider server after raw packets have been converted to TAPR-2
	  format packets.

2004-08-11 17:40  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.505), src/x_spider.c (1.19): Tweaks by Tom Russo

	* src/hostname.c (1.12), src/main.h (1.68), src/sound.c (1.9),

2004-08-10 19:59  we7u

2004-08-10 19:51  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.504), src/x_spider.c (1.16), src/x_spider.h (1.5):
	  Code that changes the process name in "ps" listings for the x_spider

	  systems, and doesn't work for "top" listings.

2004-08-09 18:32  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.15): Disabling the Nagle algorithm and enabling
	  SO_KEEPALIVE for the server port connections.

2004-08-07 18:12  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.190): Modified AGWPE parsing routine and
	  associated code.  We've now turned off "monitor" mode and turned on
	  "raw" mode in AGWPE.  The "raw" packets get thrown into our standard
	  KISS decoding routines, which gives us the possibility of supporting
	  OpenTrac (a binary protocol) and digipeating on AGWPE ports in the
	  future.  The "monitor" mode decoding has been left for now, but
	  later on we'll probably delete it.  Also:  Added output to STDERR
	  for the AGWPE server version and for the port descriptions.

2004-08-06 19:57  we7u

	  and NWS- messages.  Fixed a segfault caused by one of the new
	  strncpy() functions that I switched to in util.c:spell_it_out().

	* src/alert.c (1.75), src/alert.h (1.19), src/db.c (1.349),
	  src/db.h (1.54): Moving a couple of define's to the .h files and
	  increasing the number of alerts and messages that we allocate when
	  we run out.  This hopefully will help to keep the number of large
	  allocations down plus keep the larger allocations from ending up at
	  the very end of the heap.  If we keep a small increment, we
	  realloc() more often plus the large blocks will end up closer to the
	  end of the heap, meaning we won't be able to reduce our memory
	  impact much later.

	  Adding support for "libgc", which is a Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage
	  collection library.  The advantage for us is that it can find/report
	  memory leaks.  Install it, then add "--with-libgc" to the configure
	  line to compile it in.  It will report memory leaks on the console.
	  This patch fixes two leaks found by libgc, plus changes the

	  (1.22), src/track_gui.c (1.31), src/util.c (1.107): Combined
	  MAX_CALL and MAX_CALLSIGN defines into MAX_CALLSIGN, reduced the
	  size of it from 20 chars.  Added MAX_COMMENT_LINES and
	  MAX_STATUS_LINES, currently set to 10 each, which limit how many
	  unique status/comment lines are saved per station.  Added
	  MAX_TACTICAL_CALL in order to separate that parameter from
	  MAX_CALLSIGN, as the tactical call needs to be longer but didn't
	  want to waste the memory for all callsigns by making them all long.
	  Changed the alert memory allocation from 100 alert blocks to 25
	  alert blocks (finer grained malloc's).  Added more comments.

2004-07-09 21:11  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.490): Throwing Base-91 Compressed APRS packets into
	  our decoding instead of standard APRS packets.  This keeps the

	  Object packets are transmitted: For that setting refer to the toggle
	  on the File->Configure->Defaults dialog.

2004-07-09 17:32  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.489): Better timestamp for RINO-derived APRS
	  Objects.  Issues:  currently sends localtime instead of UTC, plus
	  the gpstrans files we're getting the timestamp from appear to have
	  the download time/date instead of the waypoint creation time/date.
	  These need to be fixed at some point.

2004-07-09 15:19  rzg

	  auto-download capability for the RINO waypoints.  A new slider added
	  to the File->Configure->Timing dialog.  A setting of 0 disables the
	  function.  Anything else invokes GPSMan at the interval selected,
	  downloading all waypoints from a RINO, and creating APRS objects out

	  support for Garmin RINO "contact" waypoints.  A new entry on the
	  Interface menu allows snagging waypoints from a RINO.  Any that
	  begin with the letters "APRS" will have those four letters removed
	  and then a standard APRS object is created from them and starts
	  transmitting out from Xastir over APRS.  We're using non-compressed
	  Objects so that they will be visible on Kenwood displays, at the
	  expense of throwing away some of the position resolution.  The menu
	  link-in may change, as we'll eventually go to an automatic poll
	  scheme of the RINO instead of this manual operation.  Currently
	  requires a connected RINO on a serial port and GPSMan support
	  compiled into Xastir.

	  working headers/libraries before we get to the compile stage.

2004-07-06 22:29  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.91): Replacing our Motif search code with better
	  code from the "vim" project.  This code is purported to find the
	  most recent variant of Motif on the system and use that, if there's
	  more than one on the system.  It also looks quite a few more places
	  for the libraries/headers than our old code.

2004-06-24 20:00  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.331), src/main.c (1.474): Removing tac-call
	  capability for objects/items.  The saving/restoring of these on
	  startup is a problem.  Perhaps we can add the functionality back in
	  later for these, but probably only if we own the objects/items
	  ourselves.  Even then, deleting the objects/items needs to be looked
	  at carefully.

2004-06-24 19:29  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.330), src/db.h (1.50), src/main.c (1.473), src/util.c
	  (1.106): Fix for Move function.  Also changed tactical call so
	  that it takes up less memory.

2004-06-23 23:19  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.472): Rearranging the Station menu slightly so that
	  it is harder to delete all stations by mistake.  It's now at the
	  bottom of the menu.

2004-06-23 19:54  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.471): Adding a define, commented out currently,
	  which sets all flags properly for a 640x480 touch-screen.  Has no
	  effect unless comments are removed.

2004-06-23 19:25  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.182), src/main.c (1.470): Backing out the
	  changes that were just made for the Serial TNC Aux GPS interface.
	  Turns out the code was right all along.  The user that is
	  experiencing difficulties with a KAM+ must have some other sort of
	  problem.

2004-06-23 18:10  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.181): Serial TNC AUX GPS interfaces weren't
	  parsing GPS data out of the datastream.  This should fix it.  More
	  testing to come.

2004-06-23 18:05  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.469): Comment changes.

2004-06-23 17:30  we7u

2004-06-22 19:36  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.329): Adding tactical call button to Station Info
	  dialog.  This is required for cases where multiple calls are near
	  the pointer, else we can't assign tactical calls.

2004-06-22 17:41  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.328): Fixed a memory leak in the expire routines,
	  where status data was not getting free'd.

2004-06-22 17:20  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.327): Fixing bug in expire code introduced by

	  src/xa_config.c (1.117): Adding a toggle flag for selecting only
	  stations with tactical callsigns.

2004-06-21 18:03  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.325), src/util.c (1.105): Restoring of tactical calls
	  from file when Xastir starts up or after all stations are cleared.
	  Dummy records are created which then get coupled to the real info
	  when the station gets heard on the air.  Also tweaked the expire
	  code so that stations with tac-calls don't get expired.  They should
	  still get cleared from the screen, but the station and all it's
	  original data, including tac-call, should appear again when the
	  station re-appears on frequency.  That new addition to the expire
	  code is not tested fully yet.

2004-06-21 16:08  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.324), src/main.c (1.465), src/util.c (1.104),
	  src/util.h (1.25): Logging of tactical calls to disk.  Added
	  Clear Tactical Calls and Clear Tactical History menu options.
	  Restore of tactical calls from disk at startup is not coded yet.

2004-06-19 05:24  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.323): Adding the callsign or the object/item name as
	  a label in the Assign Tactical Call dialog, so that we know what
	  we're renaming.

2004-06-18 20:32  we7u

2004-06-18 15:03  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.174): Putting in more dummy routines for the
	  unimplemented OpenTrac element decoding.

2004-06-18 14:30  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.463): Fixing the AUX-TNC type so that it actually
	  tries to parse the GPS sentences.  It didn't appear to do that with
	  the earlier code, while other types of interfaces did parse them.

2004-06-18 13:51  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.173): Adding parsing for more OpenTrac
	  elements.  Not much is done with the data yet, but the placeholders

	  a space before the displayname part of the OpenTrac comment.

2004-06-17 22:11  we7u

	* FAQ (1.29): Added another question/answer about problems caused
	  by the LANG environment variable setting.

2004-06-17 19:28  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.169): Limiting the comment field on the

2004-06-17 18:10  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.166): Higher-resolution OpenTrac positioning.
	  We now convert to Base-91 Compressed APRS packets before throwing
	  them into our standard decoding.  This should give us 1/100 sec
	  lat/long resolution, instead of the 60' resolution we had before.
	  This new code is untested as of yet.

2004-06-17 17:46  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.103), src/xastir.h (1.36): Adding a
	  higher-resolution lat/long format, so we can make better use of
	  OpenTrac resolution.

2004-06-17 15:06  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.165): Changing from issuing the "conv" command

2004-06-01 22:49  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am (1.16), src/Davis/Makefile.am (1.2),
	  src/Davis/src/Makefile.am (1.2): Tweaks to include the Davis code
	  in the released tgz files.

2004-05-31 05:34  we7u

	* src/dbfawk.c (1.21), src/map_shp.c (1.68): More Tom Russo fixes,
	  also removing some debug code that I added earlier.

2004-05-31 01:28  rzg

	* INSTALL (1.41), README.MAPS (1.39), help/help-English.dat (1.79):
	  Updates to all the docs, some more README.MAPS cleanups/updates.

2004-05-29 00:45  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.67): Correcting what I submitted earlier to
	  match what Tom Russo sent me.  My oops.

2004-05-28 23:02  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.69), src/map_shp.c (1.66): Tom Russo's tweak to
	  allow red flag alerts in their current transmitted form to be
	  displayed by Xastir.  Thanks!

2004-05-28 22:44  we7u

	* symbols/Makefile.am (1.8): Adding new red_flag.xbm file to the
	  mix.

2004-05-28 22:43  we7u

	* symbols/red_flag.xbm (1.1): New warning by Tom Russo.

2004-05-28 19:23  we7u

	* config/nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk (1.10), config/nwsfz_ddmmyy.dbfawk
	  (1.3), config/nwsmzddmmyy.dbfawk (1.7), config/nwsozddmmyy.dbfawk
	  (1.8), config/nwsw_ddmmyy.dbfawk (1.8), config/nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk
	  (1.10): More tweaks from Tom Russo.  This one is intended to
	  supply a "BOGUS" default value for the key if the shapefile has NULL
	  entries.

2004-05-28 19:16  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.457): Mostly comment changes.  Also removing the
	  exit when Festival can't be connected to (which I don't think worked
	  anyway).

2004-05-28 19:03  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.65): Changed an exit() to a return() for the
	  case where dbfawk fails.

	* src/hostname.c (1.10), src/sound.c (1.6): Added some comments.

2004-05-28 18:34  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.64): Comment change.

2004-05-28 18:09  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.63): Here's a fix for the missing weather alert
	  problem, when using dbfawk.  Turns out the latest zone file from
	  NOAA has an unexpected mostly-NULL entry for shape 144, which caused
	  our compare to match on that shape in all cases.  It's definitely an
	  incorrect shapefile entry, but it caused a problem in our code as
	  well which needed to be fixed.  We now check again using the title
	  length if we got a match due to the key length being 0.

2004-05-28 14:48  we7u

	* config/nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk (1.9), config/nwsfz_ddmmyy.dbfawk
	  (1.2), config/nwsmzddmmyy.dbfawk (1.6), config/nwsozddmmyy.dbfawk
	  (1.7), config/nwsw_ddmmyy.dbfawk (1.7), config/nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk
	  (1.9): Tweaks by Tom Russo to reset fill_style in each dbfawk
	  file.  Thanks!

	* src/awk.c (1.19), src/dbfawk.c (1.20), src/map_shp.c (1.62): More
	  of Tom Russo's memory leak fixes.  Thanks!

2004-05-26 21:14  we7u

	* src/awk.c (1.18), src/dbfawk.c (1.19), src/map_shp.c (1.61):
	  Minor comment changes.  Changed to correct cleanup routine for one
	  type of object.  More memory leak fixes.

2004-05-26 19:15  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.60): Adding some more "free" stuff before yet
	  another return.

2004-05-26 04:37  we7u

	* src/dbfawk.c (1.18): More comments.  Handled a few error
	  conditions.  Perhaps closed a few minor memory leaks.

	  for dbfawk.  Getting better!

2004-05-24 21:53  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.53), src/dbfawk.c (1.11): Adding some free()
	  statements to exit points in map_shp.c, to de-allocate memory that
	  was allocated earlier in the function via dbfawk calls.

2004-05-24 18:02  gstueve

	* src/main.c (1.456): Actually maintain count of visible alerts on
	  screen for increasing alert count.

2004-05-24 17:51  we7u

	* FAQ (1.28): Added a few more notes about what do do for "missing
	  Motif" messages.

2004-05-24 00:01  n2ygk

	* src/dbfawk.c (1.10), src/dbfawk.h (1.6), src/map_shp.c (1.52):

	  allow the --without flags to work properly for festival and gpsman.
	  Thanks!

2004-05-21 18:49  jtwilley

	* configure.ac (1.87): applied Tom Russo's emergency patch - will
	  examine later

2004-05-20 21:46  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.51): Closing a small memory leak in the dbfawk
	  stuff.  More to come.  Thanks to Tom Russo for finding this one.

2004-05-19 23:23  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.455): Fixing the local station so that compressed
	  posits turn off ambiguity.

2004-05-19 23:08  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.40), README.MAPS (1.37), configure.ac (1.86),
	  xastir.spec.in (1.20): Making dbfawk be compiled in by default.
	  Added --without-* flags for all of the optional libraries so that
	  they can be disabled.  Made geotiff compilation dependent on libproj
	  being present.  Made dbfawk compilation dependent on shapelib and
	  pcre being present.  The tests for the libraries are skipped
	  entirely if the proper --without-* flag is passed to configure.

2004-05-19 16:05  we7u

	* config/Makefile.am (1.13): Adding the fire alert dbfawk file to
	  the distribution.

2004-05-19 16:04  we7u

	* config/nwsfz_ddmmyy.dbfawk (1.1): Adding a dbfawk file for Fire
	  weather alerts.

2004-05-19 15:55  we7u

	* config/nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk (1.8): Latest dbfawk file for weather
	  zone shapefile.

2004-05-18 20:28  we7u

	* config/nwsz_ddmmyy.dbfawk (1.7): Added a commented line which
	  works with fire zone files.  Can't add it in yet as it appears to be
	  mutually exclusive with the other line before it which works for
	  regular zone files.

2004-05-18 20:26  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.50): Added a comment.

2004-05-18 19:54  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.36), src/map_shp.c (1.49), src/maps.c (1.404):
	  Adding support for fire zone maps.  Works now for non-dbfawk
	  compiles, but need to get dbfawk working with them as well.  The
	  WXSVR should eventually start sending these types of alerts to us on
	  firenet.

2004-05-18 16:42  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.319): Had to move the variable declarations up in the
	  code block, else it fails compile on FreeBSD.  Thanks to Tom Russo
	  for this fix.

2004-05-17 20:06  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.318): A small tweak to make the FCC/RAC lookup for
	  objects/items look at the FROM callsign instead of the object/item
	  names.  Now we can look up who is sending the objects in our
	  database.

2004-05-17 19:44  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.317): Fixing the weather alert by "Station Info"
	  lookups so that it works for more objects from the weather server.

2004-05-17 18:45  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.128), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.124), config/language-French.sys (1.124),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.128), config/language-Italian.sys
	  (1.126), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.124),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.134), src/db.c (1.316), src/wx.h
	  (1.6), src/wx_gui.c (1.32): Adding the capability to finger the
	  WXSVR if an object/item and has "WXSVR" in the path.  This is from a
	  new button "Fetch NWS Alert" in the Station Info dialog.  It takes
	  the place of the FCC/RAC button if the above conditions are met.

2004-05-13 17:17  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.85): Moving the ImageMagick check so that it is
	  the absolute last check, so that it doesn't mess up the GDAL check
	  either.  Added comments stating that the IM check should stay as the
	  last check.

2004-05-13 16:51  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.84): Moving the ImageMagick test to later in the
	  configuration.  It appears to mess up the tests for other libraries
	  if it fails.  Now only the GDAL test is below it.

2004-05-12 20:49  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.68): Additional comments.

2004-05-12 19:33  we7u

	* scripts/overlay.pl (1.3): Correcting the math for lat/long.

2004-05-12 18:56  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.161): Making sure that the AGWPE path is
	  upper-case.

2004-05-12 18:45  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.160): Fixing a bug in AGWPE path for
	  objects/items.  This bug was caused by a different use of variables
	  between the output_aprs_data() and output_my_aprs_data() functions,
	  and then copying code from one to the other without changing the
	  variables.  Variable names are now more common between them, so this
	  problem should be less likely to occur in the future.

2004-05-12 16:44  we7u

	* scripts/overlay.pl (1.2): Changes to comments.

2004-05-12 16:16  we7u

	* scripts/overlay.pl (1.1), scripts/Makefile.am (1.12): Adding
	  overlay.pl, which creates either Xastir log file format or Xastir
	  object.log format files from CSV files.  Used to create object
	  overlays (actually APRS Items in this case) out of spreadsheet data.

2004-05-11 17:07  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.95): Added a comment about an error caused by
	  line-wrap in the Shapelib Makefile.

2004-05-10 20:51  we7u

	* src/main.h (1.60), src/main.c (1.454): Adding #ifdef's for
	  "OLD_PTHREADS", which knock out the SIGUSR1 handler if
	  "OLD_PTHREADS" is defined in "main.h".

2004-05-10 19:33  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.315): Proper code for randomizing the object/item
	  transmit times a bit.

2004-05-10 16:39  we7u

	* scripts/Makefile.am (1.11): Adding a few of the newer scripts to
	  the install portion.

2004-05-09 02:54  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.453), src/db.c (1.314): Tweaking the object/item
	  timing to make sure that any changes to an object cause the object
	  to immediately go to the initial state of the decay algorithm.

2004-05-09 01:55  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.313): Fixing the random number modulus operations for
	  transmitting objects/items.  It appears however that the rand() and
	  random() functions are broken on this system, always returning 0.

2004-05-07 21:09  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.312): Reducing the randomizing of object/item TX
	  times from 33% of interval to 20% of interval.

2004-05-07 20:45  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.311): Randomizing object/item transmit a bit so that
	  they don't get transmitted together when restarting with active
	  objects/items.  This causes them to diverse fairly well after about
	  the third transmit iteration.

2004-05-07 20:21  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.101): Adding some comments.

2004-05-07 18:02  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.310): Fix for objects/items:  If we're using the name
	  of one that has already been killed, we now delete the old record
	  completely before creating the new one.  This keeps us from drawing
	  tracklines from one to the other or keeping info that doesn't apply
	  to the new object/item.

2004-05-07 16:19  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.100): Fixing the logging of objects/items.  There
	  were problems with removing spaces from Items which made them not
	  found in the search, and problems with comments in front of lines in
	  the log file.

2004-05-07 16:16  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.309), src/db.h (1.48): Comment changes.  No code
	  changes.

2004-05-06 23:27  we7u

	* src/messages.c (1.28): Reducing the initial time interval between
	  transmitted messages from 15 to 7 seconds.

2004-05-06 23:19  we7u

	* src/db.h (1.47), src/messages.c (1.27): Minor comment changes.

2004-05-06 21:40  we7u

	* src/db.h (1.46), src/db.c (1.308), src/main.c (1.452):
	  Implementing the decaying algorithm for timing of object/item
	  transmits, similar to how Bob Bruninga does it in aprsDOS.  Also
	  added a segfault fix for moving Items (same fix as done earlier for
	  moving Objects).

2004-05-04 17:59  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.39): Bumping rev. numbers for some of the optional
	  libraries.

2004-05-03 18:58  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.35): Added some geodesy links.

2004-04-30 20:27  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.38): Adding more URL's to lists of internet servers.

2004-04-29 22:30  we7u

	* FAQ (1.27): Adding a section describing the fixes for the CVS
	  hostname change at SourceForge.

2004-04-28 21:43  shadow

	* configure.ac (1.83): Test for linker support of
	  -Wl,--no-keep-memory rather than assuming it's safe everywhere;
	  MacOS 10.3.x doesn't support it.

2004-04-27 16:23  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.37): Added instructions for connecting to an internet
	  server plus a pointer to the current list of servers.

2004-04-26 19:31  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.94): Additions by Henk de Groot.  Thanks!

2004-04-26 18:14  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.159): OpenTrac patch by J. Lance Cotton, KJ5O.
	  Thanks!

2004-04-23 17:35  we7u

	* src/igate.c (1.28): Refusing to gate OpenTrac packets (which have
	  been converted to APRS-format by Xastir) to/from RF or the INET.

2004-04-21 23:01  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.451): Working version of the new Center & Zoom

	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.133), src/main.c (1.450): Starting
	  to add a new mouse menu entry:  "Center & Zoom".  Non-functional so

2004-04-14 21:31  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.82): Adding the no-keep-memory flag to LDFLAGS
	  which makes the link stage on Cygwin much faster.

2004-04-14 17:12  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.90): Specifying a minimum set of xorg packages
	  necessary for installing the X11 stuff.  Thanks to Henk for figuring

	* README.win32 (1.86): Removing the "for future development" notes
	  from the pcre descriptions.  We use that library for dbfawk support.

2004-04-09 16:44  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.34): Adding more notes that might make the initial
	  user's decision easier as to which libraries to compile in for the
	  desired functionality.

2004-04-08 16:14  we7u

	* config/Makefile.am (1.12), config/tgr2shp.dbfawk (1.1): Adding
	  Tom Russo's tgr2shp.dbfawk file to our standard set.  Useful for the
	  2003 tiger data that just came out.

2004-04-07 04:13  we7u

2004-04-01 15:25  we7u

	* src/geocoder_gui.c (1.5): Fixing a compiler warning.

2004-04-01 06:11  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.99): Better implementation of the higher resolution
	  s2l routines.

2004-04-01 04:46  shadow

	* INSTALL (1.34), help/help-English.dat (1.78): document the find
	  address feature

2004-04-01 04:26  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.98): Backing out the changes done earlier today.
	  Will try again to implement higher resolution NMEA strings at a
	  later date.

2004-04-01 04:16  shadow

	* README.MAPS (1.32): Add pointer to Census 2003 data. Add pointer
	  to geocoder data files.

2004-03-31 18:56  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.97): Extending the NMEA sentence decoding to handle
	  DD MM.MMMM format, which the new Tinytrak-3 chips can put out.  That
	  resolution ends up being 0.6 counts of our Xastir coordinate system,
	  so we need to resolve down to that level to avoid losing much.

2004-03-30 22:58  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.307): Changing from circles to an 'X' for marking a
	  found address.

2004-03-30 20:49  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.115): Saving/restoring the Mark Destination
	  button state for the Find Address function.

2004-03-30 20:44  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.306), src/geo.h (1.3), src/geocoder_gui.c (1.4):
	  Added a togglebutton that enables/disables the marking of the
	  destination for the Find Address function.

2004-03-30 20:21  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.305), src/geo.h (1.2), src/geocoder_gui.c (1.3):
	  Initial attempt at marking the destination target for a Find Address
	  query.  There's not capability yet for removing the marking, but you
	  can always seek another address and it will move to the new one.
	  Will probably change to some other marking at some point (a big 'X'
	  perhaps?), and need to find a way to remove the mark that makes
	  sense.

2004-03-30 16:58  we7u

	* src/geocoder_gui.c (1.2): Minor re-arranging of the Find Address
	  dialog's widgets.

2004-03-29 23:57  we7u

	* src/io-mmap.c (1.2): Adding an include to get rid of compiler

	  src/Makefile.am (1.15), src/main.c (1.448), src/main.h (1.59),
	  src/xa_config.c (1.114): Geocoding support added by Derrick J
	  Brashear, based off code written by Daniel Egenor that was released
	  under GPL license.

2004-03-26 18:17  we7u

	* Makefile.am (1.24): Moving the .geo files into a subdirectory
	  called "Online".

2004-03-25 16:35  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.39): Enabling setuid priviledge at the point where
	  settimeofday() is called.  Thanks to William Baguhn, kc9asi, for
	  pointing this out.

2004-03-25 01:29  shadow

	* src/macspeech.c (1.1): macspeech support, but i need to write
	  autoconf gunk, it just pretends to be festival

2004-03-23 23:12  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.33), README.win32 (1.83): Updating Cygwin
	  instructions:  com1 -> /dev/ttyS0 and similar for com2.

2004-03-23 22:59  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.14): Tweaking Cygwin serial ports to more
	  standard port names.

2004-03-23 22:56  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.37): Changes by Bruce Bennett.

2004-03-22 22:12  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.30): Moving an #ifdef so that no compiler
	  warnings are generated when ImageMagick support is missing.

2004-03-22 21:52  we7u

	* acinclude.m4 (1.13): Fixes for Cygwin regarding comm ports.

2004-03-22 17:23  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.82): Adding instructions to side-step the
	  "detecting devices" hang on WinXP.

2004-03-21 20:58  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat (1.77): Added info on the comment field in
	  interfaces; started a new tally of what changed since release.

2004-03-19 22:38  we7u

	* src/map_gnis.c (1.7): Removing trailing spaces while reading
	  lines in from GNIS files.  They are notorious for having many spaces
	  at the ends of the lines.

2004-03-19 20:37  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.47): The rest of the code needed for the
	  XReadBitmapFile() call failure, in order to make sure everything
	  keeps running.

2004-03-19 20:34  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.46): Getting rid of the exit(1) that we were
	  doing when the XReadBitmapFile() call was failing during long
	  runtimes.  It's annoying if the bitmap is not found but it shouldn't
	  kill all of Xastir in that case.  I'll be checking to see if further
	  changes to the code are necessary though to prevent segfaults
	  happening later in that part of the code.

2004-03-19 17:52  we7u

	* scripts/split_gnis.pl (1.2): Added an RCS tag.  Still needs a
	  copyright blurb.

2004-03-19 17:51  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.158): Fixing the long transmit delay, which
	  was in port_write at the final select() call.

2004-03-19 03:21  jtwilley

	* scripts/split_gnis.pl (1.1):

	  Added split_gnis.pl to scripts directory.

	  The split_gnis.pl script will take any number of state-wide GNIS
	  files listed on the command line and create smaller files based on
	  county names.

2004-03-18 23:14  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.403): Adding S57 map format to Xastir's supported
	  map types.  File extension currently has to be ".s57" for these
	  types of maps to be recognized by Xastir.

2004-03-18 18:11  we7u

	* scripts/ozi2geo.pl (1.2): Changed one comment.

2004-03-18 17:58  we7u

	* scripts/ozi2geo.pl (1.1): Initial attempt at a conversion script
	  from OziExplorer .map format to Xastir's .geo format.  This version
	  works with the one example map I had to work with.  More than likely
	  more work will be needed on the script as more types of maps are
	  tried.

2004-03-15 23:49  we7u

	* scripts/split_gnis.bash (1.2): Added a comment about "dos2unix".

2004-03-15 23:47  we7u

	* scripts/split_gnis.bash (1.1): Script written by William Baguhn,
	  kc9asi.  Splits a GNIS files into smaller pieces which are more
	  quickly loaded by Xastir when zoomed in.

2004-03-15 17:08  we7u

	* USRadar.geo (1.4): Tweaks by Gerry Creager.

2004-03-13 04:54  we7u

2004-03-11 04:11  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.71): Implementing GUI input fields for the
	  Interface->Properties "comment" field for each interface.

2004-03-10 17:50  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.70): Minor comment change.

	  (1.122), config/language-French.sys (1.122),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.126), config/language-Italian.sys
	  (1.124), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.122),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.132), src/interface_gui.c (1.67):
	  Minor tweaks to the MKISS GUI.  Not functional yet.

2004-03-09 06:54  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.125), config/language-English.sys

	  interface and for adding comments to interfaces.

2004-03-08 21:16  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.124), config/language-English.sys

	  (1.27), src/interface_gui.c (1.65), src/main.c (1.447): Initial
	  stab at creating a new SERIAL_MKISS interface type.  So far it's an
	  identical copy of the SERIAL_KISS interface type, but that will
	  change soon.  Intent is to support multi-port KISS TNC's such as the
	  Kantronics KAM.

2004-03-04 23:12  we7u

	  lcms library on Cygwin.

2004-03-02 17:56  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.27): Terraserver is playing games, changing
	  their URL again.  Changing back to the original one we used to use,
	  which works for us again.  The newer URL was returning all black
	  images.

2004-03-02 08:10  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.26): Commenting out debug output.

2004-03-02 08:07  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.402): Sending tab map files to draw_ogr_map().

2004-03-02 07:50  we7u

	* Makefile.am (1.23), src/map_geo.c (1.25): Initial version of code
	  to support Canadian Toporama maps, downloading them automatically
	  over the 'net from mm.aprs.net, including the dynamically generated
	  .geo files.

2004-03-02 07:47  we7u

	* CanadaTopo250k.geo (1.1), CanadaTopo50k.geo (1.1): Initial
	  checkin.

2004-03-01 17:31  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.30): Changing notes regarding where to find free
	  DRG maps.

2004-03-01 02:40  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.122), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.118), config/language-French.sys (1.118),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.122), config/language-Italian.sys
	  (1.120), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.118),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.128), src/interface_gui.c (1.64):
	  Tweaking the Interface Start/Stop dialog so that it is much more
	  readable.

2004-02-29 20:31  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.121), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.117), config/language-French.sys (1.117),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.121), config/language-Italian.sys

	  (1.446), src/main.h (1.58), src/xa_config.c (1.112): Added two
	  new trail sliders to the timing dialog.  They both control whether
	  trails are displayed, one based on max distance, one based on max
	  time.  If either max distance or max time are exceeded for new
	  trails, that segment is not drawn.  Does not affect trail points
	  that have already been received, just new trail points.

2004-02-28 03:12  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.445): Modifying the Move function so that it drops
	  through all the dialogs and doesn't require any OK buttons to be
	  pressed to effect the move.  This is useful for drawing the expected
	  route of a SAR team and documenting it via Shapefiles.  It's much
	  faster to do so now.  Downside: Unintentionally moving an object
	  gets an automatic confirm, and you'll have to move it back manually
	  or else edit the object.log file by hand and read it in again.

2004-02-28 02:00  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.120), config/language-English.sys

	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.126), src/main.c (1.444),
	  src/xa_config.c (1.111): Adding a "Disable Posit Dupe-Checks"
	  option to Configure->Defaults.  Disables the 30-minute dupe-checks
	  that Xastir does when each packet is received.  Does not affect
	  igate dupe-checks.

2004-02-28 01:26  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.301), src/main.h (1.57), src/util.c (1.96): Turning
	  off trail-point dupe-checking when reading in objects/items from
	  file.  This lets us show SAR teams leaving and returning to base
	  later, without having the last trail segment missing.

2004-02-28 01:00  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.300): Updating some comments.

2004-02-27 23:42  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.75): Adding notes about trails and why
	  some segments don't display.

2004-02-27 22:58  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.299): Changing the distance at which Xastir will skip
	  a track segment, from >1 degree lat/long to >2 degrees.  Any track
	  segment less than 2 degrees in N/S and E/W length will get drawn, as
	  long as the time between posits is less than 45 minutes.  If over 45
	  minutes, the segment gets skipped as well.

2004-02-26 23:25  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.156): New code to avoid opening the same
	  serial port twice for two different interfaces.

2004-02-26 23:19  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.298): Changing some debug code.

2004-02-26 21:48  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.32): Added a note about how to test the festival
	  server by telnet'ing to it.

2004-02-26 20:30  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.24), src/map_tiger.c (1.14), src/track_gui.c
	  (1.29): Fixing the problem where a failed internet download (map
	  or tracklog) would cause an older version of the same to get
	  displayed.  We now delete the old filename from our ~/.xastir/tmp
	  directory before attempting the download each time.

2004-02-26 20:07  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.297), src/db.h (1.45): Adding a retry timeout for
	  killed object/items.  We'll now transmit killed objects 11 times
	  before ceasing to transmit them.

2004-02-24 19:34  we7u

	* README (1.13): Additions by Alan Shackelford, NG3B.

	* Makefile.am (1.22), USRadar.geo (1.1), src/map_geo.c (1.22),
	  src/maps.h (1.45): Changing to an unsigned long for holding the
	  transparency value.  Adding USRadar.geo as an installed map ('cuz
	  it's just way cool).

2004-02-10 22:18  we7u

2004-02-09 20:20  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.294): Making N/S/E/W and the timestamp 'Z' non
	  case-specific.  This was requested by Bob Bruninga on the APRSSIG
	  mailing list recently (sometime in january 2004, before our last
	  stable release).

2004-02-04 16:49  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.441), src/map_shp.c (1.44): Changing some error
	  messages to provide more detail.

2004-02-03 07:10  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.78): Mods by David Flood, KD7MYC.  Thanks!

2004-02-02 22:31  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.78): Bumping the patch number so we can separate
	  development versions from most recent stable release.

	  ready for stable release.

2004-02-02 16:35  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.74): Very minor changes to the What's
	  New section.

2004-02-02 07:26  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat (1.73): Moved old "What's new" list out of
	  the way.

2004-02-02 07:23  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat (1.72): What's new section. Could use
	  proofreading and the addition of stuff I forgot.

2004-01-30 23:48  shadow

	* README (1.12): update README to reflect what's needed to get
	  MacOS X with GDAL.

2004-01-30 21:51  we7u

	* xastir.spec.in (1.19): Correcting the path to the man pages.

2004-01-30 18:12  we7u

	* symbols/symbols.dat (1.20): Implemented Wheelchair, Shelter, and
	  proposed Waypoint symbol.  Also changed one description from "HF
	  Gateway" to "Any Gateway (w/overlay char)".  The "Any Gateway"
	  symbol still needs to be changed into something which would display
	  an overlay char nicely.  The Shelter symbol may need to be changed
	  into something more recognizable.

2004-01-30 01:47  n2ygk

	* xastir.spec.in (1.18): --with-dbfawk.  Curt: toss this if you
	  feel dbfawk is not cooked enough.

	* src/main.c (1.438), src/maps.c (1.398): Commented out some dead

	  KB4AMA.  Just send a USR1 signal via "kill -USR1 <pid>" and Xastir
	  will create a new snapshot.  Useful for web page front-ends.

	* src/xa_config.c (1.107): Attempting to recover from backup file
	  renaming when things go wrong.  We'll try to get as close to the
	  original state of the files as we can.

2004-01-15 21:09  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.106): More config file backup copies code.  We
	  now back out the renaming if the new config file can't be created,
	  so we're left with the original config and two backups in that case.

2004-01-15 19:02  we7u

	* FAQ (1.23), src/interface.c (1.153), src/interface_gui.c (1.61),
	  src/xa_config.c (1.105): Simplified the all interfaces up/down
	  logic.  It should work better now.  Changed the config file backup
	  code so that xastir.cnf.1 through xastir.cnf.3 are created.  This
	  should help insulate us a bit better from crashes, as we'll have
	  more old copies of the config file to draw from if the main config
	  file (xastir.cnf) gets trashed.

2004-01-15 16:56  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.75): Adding a line in for getting rid of

	    this problem: "attempt to add non-widget child "DropSiteManager" to
	    parent "xastir" which support only widgets" while not re-creating
	    this problem: "Shell widget xastir has zero width and/or height".

2004-01-09 18:57  rzg

2004-01-09 16:11  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.79): More checks for invalid extents while

	  adding it to the index.

2004-01-08 21:38  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.434): Re-establishing the XtRealizeWidget() call in
	  main that was commented out to help fix the "zero width or height"
	  error on startup.  Now we specify a minimum size in the
	  XtVaAppInitialize() call that preceeds it, so the old problem
	  shouldn't reoccur.

2004-01-08 21:34  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.433): Gives an initial size to the application.
	  Makes it appear to come up faster.  Whether or not it actually does
	  is beside the point.  May help to get rid of the initial sizing
	  problem: "Error: Shell widget xastir has zero width and/or height".

2003-12-26 17:26  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.152): Bumping the read/write loop timeouts to
	  100ms.  This should provide reasonable response time when killing
	  ports, yet keep CPU usage low when no data is being read/written.

2003-12-26 16:17  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.151): Bumping the timeout in port_write()
	  select to 500ms.  That timeout is used to jump out of the select()
	  so that we can check whether the interface has gone down.  It does
	  not need to be very small, and in fact causes high CPU usage on
	  freebsd systems if it's below about 1ms.  Linux can handle somewhat
	  smaller delays (100us is ok on Linux).

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.68): More fill/hole polygon stuff.  Currently
	  drawing polygons with dashed lines for "hole" polygons, solid for
	  "fill" polygons.  This is if the use has decided not to fill the
	  shapes.  For filled shapes, the hole polygons aren't drawn at all

	  datums that we don't have to convert (faster again).

2003-12-12 20:31  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.58): Removing unneeded code.  Adding more
	  comments.

2003-12-12 20:20  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.56): Renaming OGR helper functions to make sure
	  there aren't any clashes later with similar functions.

2003-12-12 20:17  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.55): Speeding up OGR Point drawing.  Changing
	  default point color to white.

2003-12-12 20:03  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.54): Faster OGR line/polygon drawing by
	  checking extents on those datatypes that allow fast extent checking.

2003-12-12 20:02  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.72): Minor summary text change.

2003-12-12 16:23  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.53): Added TODO list for OGR and moved the Draw
	  routines above the main OGR routine (getting rid of the prototypes).

2003-12-12 16:04  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.24): Added a note about SDTS files.

2003-12-12 15:46  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.52): A bit of cleanup in the new OGR routines.

2003-12-12 15:30  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.51): Creating OGR Draw_Points() function which
	  is similar to the Draw_Lines() and Draw_Polygons() functions.  Skips
	  drawing points that are outside the view.

2003-12-12 14:55  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.24): Changes to the GDAL/OGR notes.

2003-12-12 01:50  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.50): Optimizing Draw_Lines() and
	  Draw_Polygons() functions in the OGR routines.  We now check the
	  extents of each feature and skip drawing it if it's not in our view.

2003-12-11 20:35  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.429), src/map_gdal.c (1.49): Fixing map_interrupts
	  so that they work properly and quickly.  A few places were broken,
	  including the new OGR code.

2003-12-11 19:42  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.48): Changed some variable names.  Added some
	  debug code, looking for sources of memory leaks.

2003-12-11 06:43  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.23): Added a new site for Shapelib.

2003-12-11 00:31  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.47): On-the-fly coordinate transforms while
	  drawing.

2003-12-10 19:14  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.392): Adding more map types that are accepted by
	  OGR.

2003-12-10 18:18  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.46): Changed some comments.

2003-12-10 18:16  we7u

2003-12-09 20:27  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.42): Drawing of OGR polygons is now working.

2003-12-09 16:55  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.41): Slightly faster drawing code due to fewer
	  sets of debug loops.  More comments.

2003-12-09 08:22  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.40), src/maps.c (1.390), src/maps.h (1.43):
	  Added a new draw function for points.  More tweaks to the OGR code.

2003-12-08 23:43  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.147): Checking that I can stat a file and that
	  it is a regular file before attempting to send a file of commands to
	  the TNC.

2003-12-08 21:22  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.39): Adding indexing for files where spatial
	  coordinate system is not known, but they still fall within the
	  normal lat/long boundaries for file extents.  We're assuming they're
	  in geographic WGS84 coordinates in this case and allowing the
	  indexing to complete.

2003-12-08 20:56  jtwilley

	* config/tnc-startup.null (1.1): Added a zero-byte file named
	  'tnc-startup.null' for those times when users do not want their TNC
	  configurations changed by xastir.

2003-12-08 20:19  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.38): Comment updates.  No code changes this
	  time.

2003-12-08 20:10  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.37): Took out some debug stuff that messed with
	  converting to nad27 datum for test runs.  Generalized the code so
	  that it works with projected coordinate systems.  No computes file
	  extents for state-plane coordinate systems.  It should also work for
	  UTM projected coordinate systems.

2003-12-08 07:50  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.36): For file extents (indexing):  Datum
	  translation is working now for geographic coordinate systems.  Not
	  implemented yet for projected coordinate systems.  Haven't
	  implemented datum translation for drawing yet.

2003-12-08 07:47  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.389): Forcing shapefiles back to the old code for
	  now.

2003-12-08 07:46  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.388): More debug for map_driver stuff.

2003-12-07 20:23  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.146): Reducing delay in port_write for
	  checking queue.  Down to 100us from 200ms.  Makes writing to
	  interfaces much snappier, but doesn't bog down CPU.  Cranking up
	  channel_data() busy wait from 1 to 2us.

2003-12-07 17:16  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.428), src/xa_config.c (1.104): Fixing the 10% zoom
	  in bug when at zoom level 1.

2003-12-06 20:10  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.35): Filling in a bit more for the OGR indexing
	  code.

2003-12-06 17:20  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.145): Reducing many of the usleep() delays
	  while transmitting to serial TNC's.  Users will have to rely on the
	  new delay slider to add delays if they get into weird operation with
	  any particular TNC.

2003-12-06 07:44  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.34): More changes to debug output.

2003-12-06 07:36  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.33): Partial map indexing working for OGR.
	  Must be geographic coordinate system.  Haven't implemented
	  conversions from other datums or coordinate systems to geographic
	  WGS84/NAD83 yet.

2003-12-06 06:33  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.32): Printing out extents now.  Should have
	  indexing implemented soon.

2003-12-06 06:02  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.31): More reformatting for debug purposes.

2003-12-06 03:11  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.30): Better formatting for OGR debug
	  statements.

2003-12-06 01:36  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.29): Filling in more features.  Slowly.

2003-12-05 22:07  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.103): Changing the default serial_char_pacing
	  to 1ms instead of 25ms.

2003-12-05 21:08  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.28): Working version of what I checked in last
	  time.  ;-)

2003-12-05 21:01  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.27): More good info in the OGR code.

2003-12-05 20:40  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.26): Fleshing out more details in the OGR
	  driver.

2003-12-05 19:39  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.102): Adding save/restore for serial character
	  pacing.

2003-12-05 19:14  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.117), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.113), config/language-French.sys (1.113),

	  src/main.c (1.427), src/main.h (1.55), src/map_gdal.c (1.25):
	  Speeding up OGR.  Adding a new inter-character delay timing slider
	  that affects serial-port TNC's.

2003-12-04 18:58  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.24): Changed some comments.

2003-12-04 18:08  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.23): Adding map interrupt capability to the OGR
	  code.

2003-12-04 16:39  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.387): Fixing up the callouts to GDAL/OGR.  We
	  direct Shapefile stuff to draw_shapefile_map() right now instead of
	  GDAL/OGR.  Tiger goes to GDAL/OGR.  This can be changed via a define
	  near the top of maps.c so that Shapefile goes to OGR as well.

2003-12-04 16:36  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.41): Getting rid of duplicate definition of
	  font_size.

2003-12-04 16:21  n2ygk

	* src/map_shp.c (1.40): fix the font_size fix to use FONT_DEFAULT

2003-12-04 08:43  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.386): Adding more vector types.  Currently
	  commented out, but the GDAL/OGR code will eventually support them.

2003-12-04 08:36  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.426): Added more vector formats to the Vector
	  button in Map Chooser.

2003-12-04 08:25  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.22): Several segfaults fixed.  Handles polyline
	  shapefiles and raw Tiger/Line polylines so far.

2003-12-04 07:23  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.39): Fixing a compile problem for non-dbfawk
	  compiles.

2003-12-04 01:08  n2ygk

	* src/main.c (1.425), src/map_dos.c (1.10), src/map_pdb.c (1.6),

	  src/xa_config.c (1.101), src/xastir.h (1.33): multiple font_sizes
	  in maps/config/map label font

2003-12-04 01:05  n2ygk

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.116), config/language-English.sys

	  config/tgrlpy.dbfawk (1.4), config/tgrplc00.dbfawk (1.4),
	  config/tgrwat.dbfawk (1.6): font_size

2003-12-03 22:18  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.23): Added a note about Tiger/Line maps (coming
	  soon).

2003-12-03 21:08  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.21): Added some comments.

2003-12-03 20:53  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.37): Removing the debug OGR code for the moment.

2003-12-03 20:52  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.20): OGR drawing for Shapefile polylines is
	  starting to work.  Not pretty yet.  Points/Polygons not working yet.

2003-12-03 20:51  we7u

	* src/maps.h (1.41): Adding a prototype for a function needed in
	  draw_gdal.c

2003-12-03 20:07  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.19): More OGR library stuff.  Am at the point
	  where I have access to the points/polylines/polygons...

2003-12-03 16:19  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.424), src/maps.h (1.40): Changing the Map
	  Properties dialog so that it only shows maps that were selected in
	  the Map Chooser.  Also the Ok and Cancel buttons in the Map Chooser
	  are greyed-out when the Properties dialog is active (necessary due
	  to the way I implemented the new feature).

2003-12-03 08:18  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.423): Added some comments.

2003-12-03 07:42  jtwilley

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.115), config/language-French.sys
	  (1.111), config/language-German.sys (1.114),
	  config/language-Italian.sys (1.113),
	  config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.111),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.121): Added "Select All" line to
	  the other language files.

2003-12-03 07:04  jtwilley

	* config/language-English.sys (1.111), src/main.c (1.422): Added
	  "Select All" button to "Map Properties" dialog.

2003-12-03 00:25  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.36): Forgot an #ifdef.

2003-12-03 00:23  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.18), src/map_shp.c (1.35), src/maps.c (1.384):
	  Debug OGR code.  Nothing truly functional yet.  Just getting a feel
	  for how to go about it.

2003-12-02 23:06  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.71): Broke libproj check out into its own section
	  and summary line.  We still need it checked in the libgeotiff
	  section as well though, as we depend on proj there too.

2003-12-02 22:16  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.17), src/maps.c (1.383): Changing some warning
	  messages.

2003-12-02 22:02  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.16): Getting rid of compiler warnings.

2003-12-02 21:50  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.70): Moving the pcre summary next to the dbfawk
	  summary at the end of configure.  Reordered some of the rest as
	  well, putting all of the map libraries together.

2003-12-01 21:13  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.5): Adding an include to make a compiler
	  warning disappear.

2003-12-01 20:56  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.22): Removing a note that is no longer needed.  CVS
	  GDAL has been tweaked to fix it.

2003-11-29 19:12  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.4): Flushing out the feature set for x_spider.
	  Not ready for prime-time yet, but getting closer.  It now echoes
	  anything received from one client out to all other connected
	  clients.  No provision yet for detecting disconnected clients and
	  removing their pipe structures.

2003-11-29 08:44  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.3): Filling in more details for x_spider.  Not
	  functional yet.

2003-11-29 08:10  we7u

	* src/x_spider.c (1.2), src/x_spider.h (1.2): More of the x_spider
	  server code filled in.  Not functional yet.

2003-11-29 06:34  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am (1.13), src/x_spider.c (1.1), src/x_spider.h
	  (1.1): Initial code for x_spider server.  This is an APRS
	  multiplexer that will eventually allow multiple other clients
	  (Xastir or otherwise) to connect to a running Xastir and TX/RX APRS
	  data between them.  This will allow the other clients to share the
	  TNC, AX.25, and network ports that Xastir is hooked up to.  The code
	  is not functional in that capacity yet, but it is a nice
	  multi-connect echo server as it stands.

2003-11-29 06:26  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.15), src/maps.c (1.382): Adding prototype for
	  draw_ogr_map().  No real code yet.

2003-11-29 06:10  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.421): Fix for the stupid "PACKAGE" warnings that
	  the GDAL include file causes.  Fix figured out originally by Jack
	  for the ImageMagick stuff, duplicated by me in the GDAL include
	  area.

2003-11-29 05:57  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.420): Slowing down the UpdateTime() loop iteration.
	  Some systems
	  (RedHat/FreeBSD) appear to use up a lot of CPU time if this is set
	  to '1' or '0'.  Setting it to '2'.  Will crank it up some more if
	  people still report high CPU usage.

2003-11-28 22:55  kd6zwr

	* src/main.c (1.419), src/map_gdal.c (1.14), src/maps.c (1.381):
	  Cleaning up GDAL init, starting gdal code.

2003-11-27 02:47  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.380): Changing from strstr() to strncmp() for
	  matching selected directories with files inside them.  Much more
	  exact.

2003-11-26 22:10  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.418): Clearing the selected bits in the in-memory
	  map index before we try to resync with the selected_maps.sys file's
	  idea of what maps are selected.

2003-11-26 20:04  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.21): Adding GDAL instructions (not that there's much
	  that can be done with it yet, but it's still nice to see the future
	  list of supported map formats on startup!).

2003-11-26 17:37  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.379): Getting rid of compiler warning when XPM is
	  not available.  This fix makes sure that the snapshot thread doesn't
	  even get defined in that case.

2003-11-26 17:00  we7u

	* src/testawk.c (1.11): Fixing another couple of compiler warnings.

2003-11-26 16:54  we7u

	* src/awk.c (1.12): Fixing more compiler warnings.  Trivial stuff.

2003-11-26 16:43  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.378): Getting rid of another compiler warning.

2003-11-26 16:35  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c (1.8): Getting rid of compiler warnings.

2003-11-26 16:29  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.377): Getting rid of compiler warnings and removing
	  dead code.

2003-11-26 16:25  we7u

	* src/map_tiger.c (1.10): Fixing a compiler warning, although I
	  can't for the life of me figure out why the compiler is confused.
	  Perhaps all of the #ifdef's confused it.

2003-11-26 16:14  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.34): Fixing a compiler warning.

2003-11-26 16:01  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.143): Changing one variable to unsigned to get
	  rid of a compiler warning.  We don't need a signed variable there
	  anyway.

2003-11-26 02:19  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.417): Converting to square meters/feet when the CAD
	  object's area is too small for miles/km.

2003-11-25 22:34  n2ygk

	* config/tgrlk.dbfawk (1.6): label color blue for water

2003-11-25 22:14  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.416): Making the End Draw Mode function write the
	  CAD objects out to disk as well.  This makes it possible to save
	  open polygons (polylines) instead of only closed polygons.

2003-11-25 20:49  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.415): Persistent CAD Objects.  They get
	  save/restored to/from file now.

2003-11-25 18:32  we7u

	* src/db.h (1.42): Changing the saved polygon area from an int to a
	  float.

2003-11-25 18:31  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.414): Leaving the calculations in square nautical
	  miles until we're finished, then converting to what the user needs.
	  Saving the area now in the object in units of square kilometers.

2003-11-25 18:01  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.413): Issuing a popup message with the area
	  measurement.

2003-11-25 17:49  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.412): More corrections to the area calculation.

2003-11-25 17:33  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.411): Forgot to add in the minus signs again.  Area
	  should be closer to being correct now for polygons.

2003-11-25 17:25  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.410): Computing area of a polygon.  Correctly now I
	  think.

2003-11-25 15:29  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.409): More CAD Drawing stuff.  We now only compute

	* INSTALL (1.19), README.MAPS (1.20): Minor updates. I'm still
	  around. :-)

2003-10-23 19:48  uid74947

	* src/maps.c (1.363): More comments.

2003-10-23 00:19  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.362): Changing the scale at which the UTM subgrid
	  starts to be drawn.  We weren't drawing it properly at scales of
	  2048 and up anyway.

2003-10-23 00:15  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.361): More comment changes.

2003-10-22 23:44  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.359): Commenting out some debug lines.

2003-10-22 23:06  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.358): Fixing another bug in draw_grid() that caused
	  a segfault while drawing UTM grids.  Added more debug and comments.
	  The segfault fix causes some grid lines to get skipped but that's
	  better than a segfault.

2003-10-22 21:39  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.357): More comment changes.

2003-10-22 21:08  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.356): Correcting some comments.

2003-10-22 20:53  we7u

	  Peter Dana.

2003-10-22 20:50  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.354): Added another comment.

2003-10-22 19:50  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.353): Adding lots of comments in the draw_grid()
	  function.  Trying to understand Olivier's code for drawing UTM
	  grids, so it can be improved in the areas of major grid
	  intersections, and in handling the irregular zone widths.

2003-10-22 18:43  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.352): Changed some comments.

2003-10-22 16:33  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.351): Last log message should have said:
	  Changed/updated some comments.  No code changes.  Same for this log
	  message.

2003-10-22 13:57  n2ygk

	* README.MAPS (1.19), config/tgrlpt.dbfawk (1.2), src/map_shp.c
	  (1.27): dbfawk symbol support for point shapefiles

2003-10-21 15:22  n2ygk

	* src/map_shp.c (1.26): duh - sym[4] to fit the null at the end!

2003-10-21 15:21  n2ygk

	* src/map_shp.c (1.25): sym[3] to allow for overlay char too

2003-10-21 15:20  n2ygk

	* README.MAPS (1.18): document "roll your own shapefile maps"

2003-10-19 22:31  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.361): Added a comment.  No code changes.

2003-10-19 22:28  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.349): Changing the UTM/UPS grid so that only two
	  zones each are drawn at the poles (in the UPS region).

2003-10-19 22:26  we7u

	* src/datum.c (1.9): Fixing the output zone number in the UPS
	  regions to "00".

2003-10-18 06:13  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.348): Tweaking the UTM grid so that it extends to
	  the poles, now that I know what the UPS grid (near the poles) should
	  look like.

2003-10-18 05:55  we7u

	* src/datum.c (1.8), src/datum.h (1.6), src/main.c (1.360),
	  src/map_geo.c (1.16), src/maps.c (1.347), src/util.c (1.84):
	  Implemented proper UTM/UPS to Lat/Long conversions.  Also fixed the
	  coordinate calculator so it would accept UPS coordinates.

2003-10-18 04:49  we7u

	* src/datum.c (1.7), src/datum.h (1.5), src/main.c (1.359),
	  src/map_geo.c (1.15), src/maps.c (1.346), src/util.c (1.83):
	  Implemented proper UPS output, when using UTM/UPS and near the
	  poles.

2003-10-18 03:22  we7u

	* src/datum.c (1.6): Temporarily making the easting and northing
	  for the UPS areas (near the poles) equal to all zeroes.  This is to
	  prevent someone thinking that the numbers we're showing are valid
	  coordinates.  We haven't been computing proper coordinates in the
	  UPS areas.  Am still working on the problem and hope to have valid
	  UPS numbers by the end of the weekend.

2003-10-17 21:21  we7u

	* src/datum.c (1.5): Changed some comments.  Added some output if
	  we're trying to convert a UPS coordinate to Lat/Long.

2003-10-17 20:39  we7u

	* src/datum.c (1.4), src/datum.h (1.4): Changed
	  utm_letter_designator() to properly handle the zones for UPS grid.
	  Still need to get the easting/northing numbers to work right, but
	  the zone letters are now correct.

2003-10-17 19:50  we7u

	* src/datum.c (1.3): Modified utm_letter_designator() function so
	  that 'Z' is displayed above 84N, and 'A' is displayed below 80S.
	  It's better than it was, but we still need to implement full UPS
	  coordinate systems in the pole regions.

2003-10-17 19:38  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.358): Tweaking TrackMouse() so that the coordinates
	  stop changing when the mouse goes off the edge of the earth.

2003-10-17 15:21  n2ygk

	* src/map_shp.c (1.24): still incomplete attempt at handling fill
	  styles.

2003-10-17 15:19  n2ygk

	* config/Makefile.am (1.9), config/tgrlpt.dbfawk (1.1): add tgrlpt
	  (Tiger/Line landmark points)

2003-10-17 15:18  n2ygk

	* config/tgrlk.dbfawk (1.2): add complete documentation of CFCC
	  codes

2003-10-17 09:13  we7u

	* bootstrap.sh (1.5): Added a line to remove the autom4te.cache
	  directory and contents.  This sometimes gets in the way when running
	  autoheader, and I have to delete it manually in that case.  No more.

2003-10-16 23:38  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.14): Excluding map indexing from being able to
	  set the map refresh interval.

2003-10-16 23:09  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.13), src/maps.c (1.345): Minor comment changes.

2003-10-16 22:59  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.12), src/maps.c (1.344): Dumping out map types
	  on startup.

2003-10-16 21:48  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.11): Changed comments.  No code changes.

2003-10-16 21:44  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.68): Moving the GDAL stuff after shapelib and
	  libgeotiff.  We want GDAL to get linked AFTER the other libraries,
	  at least until we get GDAL fully integrated.  If GDAL is linked
	  earlier than these other libraries, function calls get made to GDAL
	  instead of the correct libraries.

2003-10-16 21:42  we7u

	* src/map_tif.c (1.7): Added more debugging output.

2003-10-16 21:39  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.343): Added more debug info.

2003-10-16 21:11  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.10): Minor stuff, getting ready to try to open
	  a file.

2003-10-16 19:40  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.9): Printing out OGR drivers as well now.

2003-10-16 19:33  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.8): Nicer formatting for the GDAL drivers.

2003-10-16 19:30  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.7): Better formatting for listing GDAL drivers.
	  Starting to add code to list OGR drivers as well.

2003-10-16 18:58  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.6): Print out a list of all registered GDAL
	  drivers upon Xastir startup.

2003-10-16 16:56  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.5): Moved the #warning text inside the #ifdef
	  block.  Will only see the warning if GDAL is installed and usable on
	  your system.

2003-10-16 16:48  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.4): Minor changes to comments.  Removed a
	  #define that shouldn't have been committed.

2003-10-16 16:42  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.3): Added example code snippets from the GDAL
	  tutorial.

2003-10-16 16:07  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.67), src/main.c (1.357), src/map_gdal.c (1.2),
	  src/maps.h (1.36): More initial framework for GDAL integration.
	  Now adds it to the list of supported libraries in "configure", and
	  adds the library to the link line.

2003-10-16 15:30  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am (1.12): Adding map_gdal.c to the list of files.

2003-10-16 15:29  we7u

	* src/map_gdal.c (1.1): Adding initial file framework for
	  integrating the GDAL library.  No real code here yet.

2003-10-14 20:49  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.13): Another #ifdef fix regarding
	  raster_map_intensity.

2003-10-14 20:44  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.356): More #ifdef cleanup regarding
	  raster_map_intensity.

2003-10-14 20:37  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.355), src/maps.h (1.35), src/xa_config.c (1.92):
	  Fixing #ifdef's, consistent with new uses of raster_map_intensity
	  variable (used to be geotiff_map_intensity).

2003-10-13 21:46  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.108), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.102), config/language-French.sys (1.104),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.108), config/language-Italian.sys
	  (1.106), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.105),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.114), src/draw_symbols.c (1.50),
	  src/draw_symbols.h (1.14), src/main.c (1.354), src/main.h (1.50),
	  src/xa_config.c (1.91): Implementing Henk de Groot's icon outline
	  code.  Added code to make the changes instantly visible in the
	  drawing area.  Thanks Henk!

2003-10-13 21:30  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.353), src/map_geo.c (1.12), src/map_tif.c (1.6),
	  src/maps.c (1.342), src/maps.h (1.34), src/xa_config.c (1.90):
	  Attached geo files to the raster intensity variable, so they can be
	  darkened from the menus now.  Had to hard-code toposerver images to
	  be 100% brightness though, as the colors get strange on that
	  particular image.  Other images can be fixed by adding the
	  "modulate" tag to the .geo file, if this problem should surface
	  elsewhere.

2003-10-13 20:22  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.341): More efficient snapshot code:  Moved the .geo
	  code back into the separate thread now that the symbol-blanking bug
	  is fixed.

2003-10-13 19:57  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.340): Fixed snapshots so that .geo file creation
	  works without blanking symbols on the screen.  The code was leaving
	  incorrect values in global variables that were later used by the
	  symbol drawing code.

2003-10-13 17:57  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.352), src/maps.c (1.339), src/xastir.h (1.31):
	  Fixing the symbols-going-away-after-snapshot problem.  Unfortunately
	  it appears that the .geo code for snapshots is the problem.  Will
	  have to figure out why yet and then reinstate that part of the code.

2003-10-13 04:22  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.351), src/maps.c (1.338), src/xastir.h (1.30):
	  Attempting to fix the snapshot problem where stations disappear off
	  the display.  Created another Pixmap:  pixmap_snapshot, and copy
	  pixmap_final to it just before the snapshot thread is started.  This
	  should separate any accesses to the data so that no conflicts occur
	  while making the snapshot.

2003-10-10 02:20  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.337): Tweaking the width of the equator line in UTM
	  grid (again).

2003-10-10 02:14  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.336): Minor changes to equator/prime meridian again
	  for UTM.

2003-10-10 01:41  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.335): Changing line widths for the lat/long grid
	  and the major UTM zones to width 2.  This makes them more noticeable
	  against the smaller UTM subgrid and against map lines.

2003-10-09 20:16  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.334): Changing the color for lat/long grids as well
	  so that they work with the gc_tint stuff and show up on maps well.

2003-10-09 20:09  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.333): Changing to gc_tint for map grids so that the
	  grid can always be seen on top of maps.

2003-10-09 19:52  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.332): Switching to purple lines as they show up
	  well on topo and terraserver maps.

2003-10-09 19:47  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.331): Changing the smaller UTM grids to display in
	  bright yellow.  Easier to see on maps.

2003-10-09 16:18  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.330): Initial attempt at finer UTM grids, using
	  preliminary code by Olivier Calle
	  (N7TAP).  The code handles the irregular regions near/above Norway
	  for the major UTM grid zones only (not for the minor grids yet).
	  There are known problems near the zone boundaries with lines not
	  getting drawn or incorrect lines getting drawn.  For the most part,
	  if you're inside a zone and not in the irregular zone area, this
	  code works very well, and is very fast!

2003-10-09 16:03  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.285), src/main.c (1.350), src/map_geo.c (1.11):
	  Changing a few printf's to fprintf's.

2003-10-08 19:48  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.329): Simplified code for drawing UTM grid.

2003-10-08 19:12  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.328): Changing the UTM grid to dashed lines instead
	  of solid.

2003-10-08 18:31  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.327): Proper UTM grid, including irregular areas
	  near Norway.  Area from 84N to 90N and 80S to 90S is still in
	  question, as that is in the UPS coordinate system area (the poles).
	  Also, the UTM coordinates on the status line are incorrect when the
	  mouse pointer is moved into these areas.

2003-10-08 17:16  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.326): More draw_vector stuff.  Both Xastir
	  coordinate system and lat/long vector drawing functions work now.
	  Still need to work on the "is it in the view" code, as it's not
	  working correctly..

2003-10-08 16:42  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.325): Added more UTM grid comments.

2003-10-08 16:37  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.324): Adding a new draw_vector() function, which
	  I'll use for drawing the UTM grid shortly.  Changed/added a bunch of
	  comments in draw_grid() regarding UTM.

2003-10-07 19:59  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.323): Changed some comments.

2003-10-07 18:51  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.322): Tweaked the boundary checks before the
	  XDrawLine call.  Added/changed some comments regarding UTM grid.

2003-10-07 02:41  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.321): Initial UTM grid attempt.  This mod causes
	  the six degree vertical lines to be drawn that define the major UTM
	  zones.  It will draw them if the map grid is enabled and UTM is the
	  selected coordinate system.

2003-10-02 23:51  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.284): Fixing the Pmin/Pmax stuff so that it gets
	  transmitted properly across the air.

2003-10-02 20:21  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.320): Xastir now creates a snapshot.geo file
	  corresponding to the snapshot.png file.

2003-10-02 17:08  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.76): Added a note about removing the "-local"
	  option for nasd.

2003-10-02 14:09  n2ygk

	* src/main.c (1.349): Duh.  Hung Map_font off of Gamma_correct
	  button.

	  (please translate these!)

2003-09-28 07:03  we7u

	* src/xastir.h (1.29): Minor tweak to fix a compile problem in
	  main.c with sizeof().

2003-09-27 14:18  n2ygk

	* config/language-English.sys (1.101), src/awk.c (1.11), src/awk.h

	  (1.23), src/maps.c (1.319), src/xa_config.c (1.89), src/xastir.h
	  (1.28): Add user-selectable MAPS_LABEL_FONT.  Add
	  dbfawk-selectable label color.  Add "skip" keyword to dbfawk to
	  permit overriding bad shapefile dbf data.

2003-09-26 23:34  we7u

	  directory and subdirectories thereof.

2003-09-26 23:26  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.74): Added a note about possible problems with

	  (1.104), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.103),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.112), src/main.c (1.347): Added an
	  "Apply" button to the Map Chooser that applies the changes
	  immediately without destroying the Map Chooser.

2003-09-26 16:16  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.73): Added note about Perl 5.8 and page faults
	  while compiling.

2003-09-19 23:48  we7u

2003-09-19 22:37  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.67): Added another note about the _reent bug.

2003-09-19 17:58  we7u

	* README.MAPS (1.15): Minor changes to the download NOAA weather
	  alert maps section.

2003-09-19 17:57  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.82): Caused the code to recognize "NWS_" as valid.
	  Didn't appear to be doing so, which might have been knocking out a
	  lot of compressed weather alerts.

2003-09-19 17:57  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.283): Changed some comments.

2003-09-19 17:56  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.63): Minor changes to comments and added another
	  possible case for SOLAR that can get parsed (don't know if it'll
	  ever get used).

2003-09-18 19:38  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.346): Setting the initial symbol to be a hiker when
	  creating new object/item with probability circle toggle enabled.

2003-09-18 19:04  we7u

	  src/draw_symbols.h (1.13), src/main.c (1.344): Half of an
	  implementation for drawing Search & Rescue probability circles.
	  Have the encoding parts and display parts done.  Next need to do the
	  decoding so that the circles show up on the map.

2003-09-16 17:46  we7u

	* src/xastir.h (1.27): Adding preliminary support for the libgc
	  garbage collection library.  Disabled by default.  This gives
	  automatic garbage collection of unused memory space to Xastir.
	  During long runtimes, this seems to improve memory usage a bit.

	  SWAP buttons is enabled and we're doing the Move or Measure
	  functions.

2003-09-05 19:47  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.340): Added another define that allows moving the
	  mouse menu to button1.

2003-09-05 19:07  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.339): Swapping zoom/pan buttons so that zoom
	  buttons are more often on the screen with a small window size.

2003-09-05 13:56  n2ygk

	* config/Makefile.am (1.8), config/nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk (1.1),

	* src/main.c (1.338): Added some notes about xmodmap for swapping
	  mouse buttons in a touchscreen configuraton.

2003-09-04 22:48  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys (1.99): Making Z-In/Z-Out labels
	  shorter to help fit on 640x480 LCD screen.

2003-09-04 22:28  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.337): Changing the optional SMALL system font.

2003-09-04 21:39  n2ygk

	* src/testawk.c (1.9): Make it compile even without DBFAWK

2003-09-04 21:22  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.17): Added a bit more about libgeotiff's private
	  include directory.

2003-09-04 18:00  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.336): Another tweak for fixed-size small displays.
	  This new define forces dialogs to pop up over the main application,
	  near the left top corner.

2003-09-04 17:11  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.335): Adding an option for a much smaller default
	  system font.  Useful for smaller displays.

2003-09-04 17:10  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys (1.98): Making Zoom buttons smaller
	  by shortening the string.  Needed for smaller displays.

2003-09-04 16:40  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.334), src/xa_config.c (1.88): Allowing much smaller
	  screen sizes for Xastir.  It should start up in roughly the same
	  size as saved now also.

2003-09-04 16:18  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.333): Changing the minimum size for the main window
	  down to 1/4 VGA.  This allows it to be resized much smaller than
	  before.  Useful for fixed-size LCD displays.

2003-09-04 16:11  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.65), src/Makefile.am (1.11), src/awk.c (1.10),
	  src/dbfawk.c (1.4), src/dbfawk.h (1.4), src/map_shp.c (1.17),
	  src/testawk.c (1.8): change to use WITH_DBFAWK.  dbfawk now
	  searches for mapfilename.dbfawk before looking in config/*.dbfawk,
	  enabling map-specific special cases.

2003-09-03 07:28  kd6zwr

	* src/map_geo.c (1.8), src/maps.h (1.32): Adding TRANSPARENT and
	  CROP tags to the geo file.  First cut at transparent, needs to be
	  augmented to allow a list of colors to zap.

2003-09-02 23:43  jtwilley

	* configure.ac (1.64): Moved AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE and added arguments.

	  Added documentation for AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.

2003-09-02 21:05  n2ygk

	* config/tgrcty.dbfawk (1.2), src/map_shp.c (1.16): tgrcty: fix
	  Louisiana FIPS code map_shp: start adding layer setting via dbfawk
	  too

2003-09-02 17:50  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.64): Added another comment about "nano" being
	  more user-friendly than "vi", for people coming from a Windows
	  background.

2003-08-30 20:41  jtwilley

	* src/awk.c (1.9): Added reference to <sys/types.h> to match
	  dbfawk.c

2003-08-29 16:50  n2ygk

	* configure.ac (1.63), config/Makefile.am (1.7),

	  (1.2), src/tgrkgl.dbfawk (1.2), src/tgrlk.dbfawk (1.2): gps.c:
	  handle spurious compile time warning everything else: add dbfawk
	      support for shapefile maps.  Enable with: ./configure --with-dbfawk

2003-08-23 04:37  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.59): Adding another #include, needed for
	  usleep() call.

2003-08-21 22:01  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.280): Changed some comment formatting.

2003-08-21 21:10  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.58): Adding a delay after shutting down a
	  port before it is brought up again.  These delays are in the
	  interfaces->properties menu when changing an interface that's
	  running.

2003-08-21 19:31  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.279), src/db.h (1.38): Added a new flag to WeatherRow
	  called wx_storm.  We wet it when we find any kind of a severe storm,
	  then use that flag in our logic that decides how to draw things.
	  This gets rid of wind barbs for some severe storms.

2003-08-21 18:01  we7u

	* scripts/inf2geo.pl (1.4): New revisions by ZL2UMF.  Thanks!

2003-08-21 16:42  we7u

	* src/igate.c (1.25): We now drop generic queries heading to RF.
	  Also tweaked the log reject messages to be more consistent.

2003-08-21 16:30  we7u

	* src/igate.c (1.24): Removed the '*' requirement for TCPXX*, so we
	  now reject anything with TCPXX in it.  Added NOGATE options for
	  dropping packets to all igate functions.  Added generic query
	  rejection for gating to 'net.  Still need to add it into the
	  gate-to-rf code.

2003-08-20 19:55  we7u

	* symbols/symbols.dat (1.18): Changing the "smoke" symbol so that
	  it shows a volcano instead of a smokestack.  This is more inline
	  with the reason the weather server puts out these symbols, and is
	  more recognizable than the smokestack symbol anyway.

2003-08-20 18:05  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.332): Changing the network port check from 7.5
	  minutes down to one minute.  This should reconnect ports more
	  quickly if/when they go down.

2003-08-18 23:16  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.278): Removing a back-slash that got in there
	  accidentally.

2003-08-18 22:46  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.277): Getting the sort order correct for inserting
	  records into the station database.  Didn't work well with the wrong
	  order.

2003-08-18 18:09  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.276): Commenting out some speedup code in
	  station_shortcuts_update_function() that may be causing problems at
	  present.

2003-08-18 17:40  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.318): Henk's fix to a pointer problem that I
	  created recently.

2003-08-17 06:04  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.275): Fixing a bug in the hash table code which looks
	  for station matches.  Making the clear all stations function faster
	  by clearing out the hash table first.

2003-08-16 01:40  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.317): Making index_retrieve() faster by relying on
	  alphanumerical ordering of the map files in the index list.  We now
	  save the pointer between runs, and start searching the list at the
	  point we left off.

2003-08-16 01:12  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.331): Minor comment cleanup and removing dead code.

2003-08-16 01:04  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.330): Better pointers for Map Chooser select
	  updates.

2003-08-16 00:53  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.329): Changing from n*n searches to n searches for
	  updating selected bits when closing Map Chooser.

2003-08-16 00:12  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.140): Bumping out of port_read less often.
	  This is only to check whether the thread should be taken down
	  anyway.  If a packet is waiting for us to read it, we'll wake up out
	  of the select() anyway.

2003-08-15 23:55  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.328): Rearranging some if statements to get a
	  little more speed out of it.

2003-08-15 23:11  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.327), src/maps.c (1.316), src/maps.h (1.31): Added
	  caching of XmString values corresponding to the map filenames for
	  the Map Chooser.  The first time bringing up Map Chooser will be at
	  the same speed as before.  Second and succeeding invocations of the
	  Map Chooser should be a bit faster because the XmString's are used
	  from the map index records again instead of being created from
	  scratch each time.

2003-08-15 19:30  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.139): CPU-usage optimization tweak to
	  port_read().

2003-08-15 19:11  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.138), src/main.c (1.326): CPU-usage tweak for
	  dtr_all_set calls.  It was getting called constantly whenever an HSP
	  port was enabled.

2003-08-15 18:51  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.315): CPU-usage tweak to index_retrieve().

2003-08-15 18:20  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.274): Yet another CPU-usage tweak.  This one is to
	  search_station_name().  It's more efficient now at finding stations
	  in the linked list, using a hash table as a jumping-off point.

2003-08-14 22:02  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.14): Changing the level at which shorelines get
	  drawn.

2003-08-14 21:59  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.13): Setting up more levels at which things
	  won't be drawn.  Will make things faster/less cluttered.

2003-08-14 21:46  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.12): Optimizing shapefile vector drawing.  We
	  don't convert the coordinates for each point now unless we're going
	  to draw the darn thing.

2003-08-14 20:52  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.314): More speedups.

2003-08-14 20:27  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.11): Added some comments.

2003-08-14 16:12  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.325), src/maps.c (1.313), src/maps.h (1.30),
	  src/xastir.h (1.26): First part of speeding up Shapefile drawing
	  by staying with lat/long values as much as possible, rather than
	  doing conversions to Xastir coordinate system at every step.  The
	  end goal is to do as little math as possible to put pixels on the
	  screen.  These changes give a slight speedup to shapefile drawing,
	  noticeable only when loading lots of maps.

2003-08-13 23:26  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.10): Reverting back to last version.  Floats
	  made CPU-usage worse in this case.

2003-08-13 22:49  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.9): Speedups.  Using floating point operations
	  instead of unsigned longs.

2003-08-13 19:45  gstueve

	* .cvsignore (1.1), callpass/.cvsignore (1.1), config/.cvsignore
	  (1.1), help/.cvsignore (1.1), m4/.cvsignore (1.1),
	  scripts/.cvsignore (1.1), src/.cvsignore (1.1),
	  symbols/.cvsignore (1.1): Ignore generated files within CVS base.

2003-08-13 19:38  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.48): Made the symbol() routine more
	  efficient.  Uses much less CPU now.

2003-08-12 18:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.137): More performance improvements.

2003-08-12 18:45  we7u

	* src/popup_gui.c (1.13): Another performance improvement.  Only
	  check for expired popups every two minutes.

2003-08-12 17:29  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c (1.21): Another performance improvement.  The
	  timing was set up such that find_zero_position_bulletins() ran every
	  time UpdateTime() was started.  We now wait 15 seconds between each
	  invocation.

2003-08-11 23:57  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.273), src/messages.c (1.24): More optimizations for
	  speed/CPU-usage.  Hash table entry creation is now more efficient.
	  Check_and_transmit_messages now gets skipped if we ran it already
	  that second.

2003-08-11 23:15  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.324): Added a comment.

2003-08-11 23:05  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.15): Added RH9 ImageMagick instructions, courtesy of
	  Wes Johnston.

2003-08-11 22:40  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.272), src/main.c (1.323): Moved station # display
	  code from db.c to main.c:UpdateTime() so that the number of stations
	  will accurately reflect our count even when no packets are coming
	  in.

2003-08-11 22:08  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.136): Another performance/CPU-usage tweak.

2003-08-11 21:48  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.322): Another performance tweak.  This one lets you
	  handle multiple high-speed 'net connections and keeps up with the
	  receive queues.

2003-08-11 21:07  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.135): Performance enhancements.  Helps Xastir
	  to keep up with very fast network interfaces.

2003-08-11 20:24  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.321): Making UpdateTime() run more often, which
	  helps us keep up with fast internet feeds.

2003-08-11 19:57  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.271): Changing how often we check for stations and
	  messages to expire from our database.  This should also reduce CPU
	  usage.

2003-08-11 18:31  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c (1.20): Another CPU-usage tweak.  Running
	  through all of the messages looking for new bulletins every 15
	  seconds instead of every 2.  Keeps mscan_file() calls down a bit,
	  which is using a lot of CPU if run often.

2003-08-11 14:04  n2ygk

	* src/awk.c (1.7), src/awk.h (1.4), src/dbfawk.c (1.2),
	  src/dbfawk.h (1.2), src/testawk.c (1.6): Save a newer snapshot of
	  in-progress code.  Still not baked.

2003-08-09 01:03  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.270): Implementing a 14-bit hash table for station
	  record lookup.  This appears to have a BIG effect on CPU usage.  May
	  be a bit before the codebase is stable again though, but the gains
	  are definitely worth it.  It gives us a feeling for what an SQL
	  database will do for us.

2003-08-08 23:16  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.269): Implemented an array of pointers for the
	  station linked list.  Each entry represents one possible starting
	  letter/number for the callsign.  We use this to speed up the search
	  for a particular record, which is our hardest hitter in terms of
	  CPU-usage right now.  This appears to reduce Xastir's CPU
	  requirements by quite a bit, particularly when a lot of stations are
	  in the database.

2003-08-07 20:47  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.47): Backing out one change which broke the
	  port activity symbols.  They're working again now.

2003-08-07 17:01  we7u

	* src/Makefile.am (1.9): Taking out the awk/dbfawk stuff
	  temporarily until it can be compiled on most systems again.

2003-08-07 00:54  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.312): Another speedup.

2003-08-06 23:19  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.46): Speeding up the loading of symbols.

2003-08-06 23:18  we7u

	* src/lang.c (1.9): Breaking out of a loop as soon as we get a
	  non-match.

2003-08-06 17:43  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.63): Added a note regarding Windows not allowing
	  access to files at times.

2003-08-05 14:34  n2ygk

	* src/Makefile.am (1.8), src/awk.c (1.6), src/dbfawk.c (1.1),
	  src/dbfawk.h (1.1), src/testawk.c (1.5): more dbfawk utility
	  functions.  I'll be integrating this into map_shp.c RSN!

2003-08-04 23:13  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.320): Another small change which makes a difference
	  in CPU usage.

2003-08-04 22:36  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.45): Changing draw colors only when
	  necessary.  Found this one while profiling using gprof.  May be more
	  to change in this procedure to speed things up a bit..

2003-08-02 17:00  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.319): Tweaked Coordinate Calculator so that it
	  checks lat/long minutes/seconds values for negative numbers and >=
	  60.0.  If out-of-range numbers are found, the error text is
	  displayed in the dialog and a warning message is written to STDERR
	  with a bit more detail on the problem found.  Later this STDERR
	  output should probably go to a popup or the main dialog instead, and
	  language strings should be created for them.

2003-07-31 16:01  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c (1.14): Making the Close button larger.

2003-07-31 15:21  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c (1.13): Made the View->All Messages dialog
	  resizable in both directions.

2003-07-31 13:00  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c (1.19): Fixed View->Bulletins dialog so that
	  it is resizable in both directions.

2003-07-28 05:20  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.268), src/main.c (1.318): Improved Display Packet
	  Data dialog.  This one is resizable and very fast.  Much better than
	  the previous implementation.

2003-07-27 00:11  we7u

	* symbols/symbols.dat (1.17): Added the MODIS Earth Observation
	  symbol.  Added a comment specifying where to find the color
	  definitions used for symbols.

2003-07-26 16:35  we7u

	* src/map_dos.c (1.9): Commented out some fprintf's that were
	  getting quite verbose when certain Win/DOS maps were loaded.
	  Warnings were that we were trying to call draw/fill polygon routines
	  with 1 or 2 points.

2003-07-25 20:00  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.317): Cranked up the delay on REDRAW from 2 to 3
	  seconds.  Changed the dead-reckoning code to schedule a map redraw
	  instead of doing on itself (which probably duplicated some drawing).
	  CPU usage seems to be down because of these changes.

2003-07-25 18:18  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.35): Improved GPS parsing code.  Fixed buffer
	  overflow problems and restructured code.

	  put into the maps/GPS directory will show up properly.

2003-07-22 18:15  we7u

	  take effect while loading maps.

2003-07-18 20:58  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.62): Removing -Wall from configure.ac.  Jack
	  Twilley added the correct fix to acinclude.m4.

2003-07-18 20:52  jtwilley

	* acinclude.m4 (1.11): Wrapped gcc-specific tests in an if test for
	  gcc.  Added -Wall to CFLAGS when using gcc.

2003-07-18 20:15  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.61): Adding "-Wall" to CFLAGS.  Not sure if this
	  is the perfect way to get it included into src/Makefile, but this
	  method definitely works.

2003-07-18 19:49  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.33): Adding a define necessary before including
	  time.h, in order to get strptime() function defined on some versions
	  of Linux.

2003-07-18 19:12  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.133): Adding casts to first parameter of
	  pthread_cleanup_push() so that after macro substitution the compiler
	  is still happy with the 2nd parameter of _pthread_cleanup_push().

2003-07-18 18:13  we7u

	* INSTALL (1.14): Removing tabs.

2003-07-18 13:14  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat (1.64): Moved some stuff around, AGWPE now
	  a section, minor corrections.

2003-07-18 02:29  n2ygk

	  src/awk.c (1.1), src/awk.h (1.1), src/testawk.c (1.1): Start
	  adding support for my awk-like metadata for shapefiles: Tests for
	  -lpcre, documentation of where to find pcre, and awk.c, awk.h which
	  is the code that will be called once I get the nerve to do some
	  serious hacking on map_shp.c:-)

2003-07-17 21:54  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.59): Added another note about the .cvspass file.

2003-07-17 19:37  we7u

	  time.

2003-07-16 21:07  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.132): Installing thread cleanup routines.
	  These should take care of unlocking mutex's when the threads
	  terminate for any reason.  Should keep the rest of the program
	  running.

2003-07-16 05:25  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.57): Changing the note about creating the .cvsrc
	  file.  Trying to make it VERY CLEAR that a Unix-type editor must be
	  used.

2003-07-15 22:58  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.79): Changing the begin_critical_section() functio
	  (mutex locks).  If a resource has already been locked, output a
	  warning message and skip trying to lock again.  This should allow
	  Xastir to recover should locks or unlocks be tried twice or more in
	  sequence.  Warning messages will get printed, but the threads should
	  continue to run.

2003-07-15 22:42  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.312): Adding the busy cursor in a couple of places
	  so that we have a better indication of when map drawing is taking
	  place.

	  up the GPS timing if it is set lower than 3 seconds.  We also now
	  present a popup to the user to notify them that the GPS timing has
	  been changed.

2003-07-15 20:23  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.310): Adding a timeout for HSP ports for GPS
	  listener mode.

2003-07-15 19:34  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.131): First attempt at fixing some of the HSP
	  interface's problems.  This one will send strings other than GPGGA
	  and GPRMC through the normal decoding sequence.  That will at least
	  process received TNC strings, which the previous code did not.

2003-07-15 18:13  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.78): Skip copying final pixmap to display if we
	  have a map interrupt.

2003-07-15 18:08  we7u

	  Update to newer emacs c-basic-offset

2003-07-14 21:37  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.56): Changed "diff" to "diffutils", as they
	  apparently changed what package "diff" could be found in.

2003-07-14 21:26  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.55): Adding a blurb about the final-final dialog
	  for Cygwin installs that must have it's OK button pressed for the
	  whole thing to finish.

2003-07-14 20:31  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.63), help/help-German.dat (1.8),

2003-07-11 15:44  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.76): GMT -> Localtime fixes for both Unix and
	  Cygwin.

2003-07-10 20:25  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.75): Timezone changes for Cygwin.

2003-07-10 19:06  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.130): Changes for HSP.

2003-07-10 19:00  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.44): Forcing expire of severe weather
	  polygons at a 10 minute interval, ignoring the user-settable
	  ghosting period for these objects.

2003-07-10 00:18  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.308): Changing one comment.

2003-07-10 00:18  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.129): Changing some usleep's throughout.
	  Mostly making them larger, having to do with starting/stopping
	  interfaces.

2003-07-10 00:04  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.57): Backing out a few of the TAB_GROUP
	  items.  Don't work for some widgets.  Cause segfaults.  This version
	  appears to work properly.

2003-07-09 23:34  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.56): Setting up tab groups for all of the
	  interface GUI dialogs.

2003-07-09 22:55  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.55): Fixing tab groups for

	  to come for other interface types.

2003-07-09 22:26  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.43): Detaching multipoint object drawing
	  from the "Include Expired Data" toggle.  They now expire at the
	  ghosting interval.

2003-07-09 22:02  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.86): Making the default for displaying old
	  data equal to zero now instead of 1.

2003-07-07 23:51  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.307): Causing display updates once per 60 seconds,
	  even with no input triggers.

2003-07-07 23:19  we7u

	* src/map_shp.c (1.4): Adding in maximum zoom levels for various
	  water features.  They still need fine-tuning.

2003-07-07 21:30  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.263): Added a limit to the number of trackpoints
	  displayed in Station Info.  This prevents lockups when display
	  Station Info on extremely long paths, for instance:  TrackMe with
	  GPS enabled, displaying Station Info on my own station.

2003-07-07 21:20  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.306): Added in the map interrupt stuff for drawing
	  symbols/tracks.  Maps and symbols/tracks now appear to be drawn &
	  interrupted together.

2003-07-07 20:56  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.128): Tweaks for HSP interfaces.  DTR should
	  be reset now after sending waypoint strings out to the GPS on an HSP
	  port.

2003-07-07 20:23  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.305): Changed some comments.

2003-07-07 20:22  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.127): Changed a comment.

2003-07-07 18:09  we7u

	* scripts/xastir-fixcfg.sh (1.3): Script now removes the
	  map_index.sys file and moves the selected_maps.sys file to
	  selected_maps.sys.backup

2003-07-07 17:57  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.307): Changed some comments.

2003-07-07 17:17  we7u

	* scripts/icontable.pl (1.4): Changed path to match new Xastir
	  directory structure.

2003-07-07 16:33  we7u

	* UPGRADE (1.5): Added instructions for migrating to Xastir's new
	  directory structure.

2003-07-05 15:28  n0vh

	* scripts/fcc-get (1.2): Updated to reflect the new directory
	  structure.

2003-07-04 22:17  we7u

	* scripts/xastir-migrate.sh (1.3): Changing script so that it
	  deletes the old files and not the new.

2003-07-04 19:32  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.262), src/location.c (1.3), src/main.c (1.304),
	  src/main.h (1.47), src/map_dos.c (1.6), src/map_geo.c (1.4),
	  src/map_gnis.c (1.3), src/map_pdb.c (1.3), src/map_shp.c (1.3),
	  src/map_tif.c (1.3), src/map_tiger.c (1.3), src/maps.c (1.306): A
	  better implementation of the interrupt-map-loading function.  We
	  still end up with tracks/stations drawn strangely when we first
	  interrupt, but that's the next problem I'll tackle.

2003-07-04 17:10  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat (1.62): Listing the last few changes...

2003-07-04 09:11  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.303): Made some of the mouse and keyboard
	  operations interruptible.

2003-07-03 21:30  we7u

	* src/map_dos.c (1.5), src/map_geo.c (1.3), src/map_gnis.c (1.2),
	  src/map_pdb.c (1.2), src/map_shp.c (1.2), src/map_tif.c (1.2),
	  src/map_tiger.c (1.2): More map interrupting capability.
	  Currently works for resizing quite nicely.

2003-07-03 20:23  we7u

	* src/map_geo.c (1.2), src/maps.c (1.305): Adding in more map
	  drawing interruption capability.

2003-07-03 19:13  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.302), src/main.h (1.46), src/maps.c (1.304): Added
	  some flags that get set by da_resize, which then immediately exits
	  allowing X11 to continue.  If interrupt_drawing_now is set, map
	  drawing ceases after the map we're currently loading is finished.
	  If request_resize is set, then a resize operation is started by
	  UpdateTime.  We can add checks for interrupt_drawing_now to other
	  routines later in order to stop map drawing more quickly.  Next is
	  to do a similar thing for the da_input function, so that a keypress
	  or mouse click can interrupt map loading.

2003-07-03 17:32  n2ygk

	* scripts/Makefile.am (1.9): eliminate duplicate config data

2003-07-03 17:07  n2ygk

	  (1.6), help/Makefile.am (1.4), scripts/Makefile.am (1.8),
	  symbols/Makefile.am (1.6): Changed locations of shared xastir
	  files.  After make install you should run scripts/xastir-migrate.sh
	  and scripts/xastir-fixcfg.sh.  The former fixes the shared files
	  directory.  The latter fixes your personal xastir.cnf references to
	  those shared files.

2003-07-02 21:03  n2ygk

	* scripts/Makefile.am (1.7), scripts/xastir-fixcfg.sh (1.1),

2003-06-30 16:52  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.302): Commenting out an unused function.

2003-06-30 16:52  we7u

	  functions to use the local users' ~/.xastir/gps and
	  ~/.xastir/tracklogs directories.

2003-06-21 02:05  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.299): Starting to move GPS and Save station trail
	  functions so that they use ~/.xastir/gps and ~/.xastir/tracklogs
	  directories.

2003-06-21 01:27  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.298), src/track_gui.c (1.26): Shortening the temp
	  files to get rid of "xastir_" and the username.

2003-06-20 23:55  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.299), src/track_gui.c (1.25), src/maps.c (1.297):

	  (1.12), src/main.c (1.298): Tweaks to display signpost symbol
	  data next to symbol.  Also allow letters now instead of just digits,
	  as the spec appears to allow this.  Next thing to bring us fully
	  into compliance is to only show the signpost data at close-in zoom
	  levels (minor), and perhaps also to show the data on top of the sign

2003-05-13 21:56  jtwilley

	* README.win32 (1.30): Added Kirk Mefford's suggestion re: creating
	  .cvsrc file

2003-05-13 06:59  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.250): CPU Usage fixes.  We no longer do complete
	  symbol updates at a high rate.  We update only the new symbol, then
	  do cleanup at a 60-second rate sometime later.  CPU usage drops a
	  bit with this latest code.

2003-05-12 23:59  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.275): Slowed down UpdateTime() iterations so that
	  the read/write threads would have time to do their thing.  Cranked
	  up the maximum packets processed by UpdateTime() in one iteration.
	  Added a usleep() after processing each packet so that the read
	  threads would have time to put another packet in the queue.  CPU
	  time has gone down by these changes, but we still appear to keep up
	  with the incoming packets.

2003-05-12 23:56  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.116): Speeding up the receive threads.  They
	  don't take any CPU time anyway, so this doesn't hurt CPU usage.
	  They process one line then wait for the main thread to pick it up
	  before they process the next line.

2003-05-12 20:59  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.274): Changing main.c:UpdateTime() to wait 15ms
	  between each run instead of 10.  This reduces CPU time a bit, yet
	  still allows packets to get processed from the receive queues.  20ms
	  appeared to be too slow.  Will investigate adding longer delays
	  between graphics updates in this routine, yet allowing packet
	  processing to proceed at a fast pace.  That should further reduce
	  CPU cycles yet not get behind in the receive queues.  At that point
	  we might reduce the delay again between UpdateTime() runs.

2003-05-12 19:39  we7u

2003-04-25 22:45  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.249): Changing to "Nonconvex" parameter for the
	  rest of the XFillPolygon calls.  This should speed up drawing a bit.

2003-04-25 22:30  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.248): Changing XFillPolygons to use Nonconvex
	  parameter, which speeds up map drawing for cases where the line
	  doesn't cross its own path.  Added some comments.

2003-04-25 22:29  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.90), config/language-French.sys
	  (1.88), config/language-Italian.sys (1.88),

2003-04-25 20:36  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.26), README.1ST (1.115): Added notes about
	  libcurl.

2003-04-25 00:25  jtwilley

	  There are problems with 5.8.0 yet.

2003-04-23 20:16  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.112): Changing port_read() to a 50ms delay
	  instead of 20ms.  Last checkin was a slight oops.

2003-04-23 20:15  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.111): Speeding up the port_read() and
	  port_write() delays again.  We were starting to get behind at
	  processing packets from full-feeds, with 100ms delays.  Changed to
	  50ms delays and we appear to catch up when we get a bit behind.  The
	  correct solution for this is to use select() to wait for data to
	  process, instead of using it as a short sleep function.  Something
	  to change another day...

2003-04-23 06:08  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.245): Minor revisions to the create_shapefile from
	  APRS Trail functions.  Maps are now saved in the /maps/GPS/

	  on the Station Info dialog now saves the station track as a
	  Shapefile map in /var/tmp/, if Shapelib has been compiled in.  The
	  Shapefile filename will contain the callsign and a date/timestamp.
	  The original function of the button still remains as well:  It also
	  saves the info in the original text format.

2003-04-22 08:35  jtwilley

	* src/main.c (1.268): Added tnc_data_clean call to static TNC case.

2003-04-11 18:17  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.100): Added code to disable Nagle's algorithm

	* src/interface.c (1.95): Changing input parameter for
	  send_agwpe_packet() to accept a digi path instead of a list of

2003-04-08 06:17  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.93): Initial transmit capability for AGWPE
	  interfaces.  Currently the path is hard-coded to RELAY,WIDE2-2, but
	  that will change given time.  The method of specifying the path
	  differs greatly from Xastir's original method, plus the Properties

2003-04-07 17:26  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.92): Commenting out some debugging printf's.

	  functional.  Transmit is still being worked on.

2003-04-05 19:16  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.90): More AGWPE code.  We're getting packets
	  sent in both directions now, although the login/password packet
	  doesn't appear to be accepted properly yet.  No decoding/encoding of
	  real packets is implemented yet.

2003-04-05 00:55  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.82): Fixing this so that it handles the

2003-04-04 19:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.86): More AGWPE interface code.  Now sending
	  login/password string and command to ask AGWPE to send us the
	  monitored packets.  Don't have transmit or the receive decode of
	  those packets completed yet, but debug code is in place that looks
	  for complete headers and packets and notifies us on reception.

2003-04-04 07:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.85): More AGWPE stuff.  Not functional yet.

2003-04-04 01:12  we7u

2003-04-03 20:57  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.261), src/maps.h (1.22): Adding my
	  test_create_shapefile stuff back in, this time with the proper
	  #ifdef's so that everybody can still compile the code whether they
	  have shapelib installed or not.

2003-04-03 19:52  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.260), src/maps.c (1.239): Spawning off a separate

2003-04-03 17:39  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.238): Changing the Snapshot function so that it can

2003-04-02 21:01  francais1

	* src/interface.c (1.81): Enable suid privileges around bind to
	  reset from callsign (RELAY digipeat bugfix with 2.2.19 kernels, I
	  hope.)

2003-04-02 19:30  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.259): Disabling my test_create_shapefile_map entry.
	  Some people can't get Xastir to compile with it in there, and it's
	  test code anyway.

2003-04-02 00:27  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.258), src/maps.c (1.237), src/maps.h (1.21):
	  Testing of the shapefile creation function.  Attached to the "Test"
	  button on the menus.

2003-04-01 23:25  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.236): Changed to comments.  No code changes.

2003-04-01 21:13  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.80): Adding some white space.  No code changes
	  this time.

2003-04-01 17:55  we7u

	* src/xastir.h (1.24): Enabling serial KISS tnc relay digipeat
	  functionality by default.  Initial testing shows that this portions
	  of relay digipeat is working.  AX.25 relay digipeat still needs a
	  bit of work to get the source callsign to be set properly.

2003-04-01 09:09  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.233), src/interface.c (1.79): Changes to make RELAY
	  digipeating functional for Serial KISS TNC interfaces.  May have
	  fixed AX.25 interfaces as well.

2003-04-01 07:16  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.232): Better debug output for relay_digipeat()
	  function.

2003-03-31 23:31  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.231): More debug messages for relay_digipeat()
	  function.  Again, will be removed later.

2003-03-31 22:59  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.230): Adding some debug output for relay digipeat.
	  It'll be removed later when we get things working properly.

2003-03-29 01:05  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.229): More KISS variant comments.

2003-03-29 00:37  we7u

2003-03-29 00:34  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.227): Added some notes about KISS protocol variants.
	  No code changes.

2003-03-28 19:13  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.235): Changing point shapefiles so that if labels
	  are turned off, the symbols still get drawn.

2003-03-28 18:33  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.78), src/db.c (1.226): Added comments.  Now
	  mask off the AX.25 P/F bit before checking the control byte for 0x03
	  (UI Frame).  Now drop the Serial KISS packet if the final result is
	  not 0x03.

2003-03-27 23:57  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.225): Taking out the control byte == 0x03 restriction

	  files could be written there.

2003-03-27 23:33  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.223): Changing the Serial KISS interface to ignore
	  packets if the control byte != 0x03 and the PID byte != 0x0f.  This
	  will make it co-exist on channels that might have other protocols on
	  them (net/rom, tcp/ip, etc.).  The AX.25 interface code already had
	  the PID==0x0f restriction on it.

2003-03-27 22:32  we7u

	* README.win32 (1.19): Changed "go.bat" to just "go".  Less typing
	  to get things rolling that way.

	* src/gps.c (1.27), src/interface.c (1.75), src/main.c (1.251),
	  src/xastir.h (1.22): Fixes for the GPS high-CPU usage.  We now
	  save GPRMC and GPGGA strings in global variables, dropping all other

	  to change the weather alert code to make it independent of the

	  is to just throw the alert onto the alert_list and skip the message
	  database portion altogether.  This current code appears to still be
	  fully functional w.r.t. weather alerts.

2003-02-24 22:45  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.219): Re-org of a bit of code w.r.t. weather alerts
	  (no major changes though).  Lots of comment changes.

2003-02-24 21:58  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.34): Tweaks to watch boxes for Gerry
	  Wheeler.

2003-02-24 21:35  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.218): Removed dead code.  Changed some comments.

2003-02-24 21:04  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.53), src/maps.c (1.217): Changes to comments only.

2003-02-24 20:46  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.52), src/main.c (1.234): Setting the proper
	  variables so that a screen update happens in a timely manner after
	  WX alerts expire.

2003-02-24 20:23  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.51), src/main.c (1.233), src/maps.c (1.216),
	  src/wx_gui.c (1.27): We now expire wx alerts only in
	  main.c:UpdateTime(), and only every 60 seconds.  If any are expired,
	  it schedules a screen update.

2003-02-24 19:41  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.50), src/alert.h (1.13), src/maps.c (1.215): More
	  minor work on wx alerts.

2003-02-24 19:25  jtwilley

	* src/interface.c (1.71): Changed timeouts to 100 milliseconds from
	  100 microseconds.

2003-02-24 18:25  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.49), src/alert.h (1.12), src/maps.c (1.214),
	  src/wx_gui.c (1.26), src/xa_config.c (1.80): Moved alert
	  expiration code into common alert_expire() function.

2003-02-23 16:58  we7u

	  now for wx alert expiration.

	  src/util.c (1.62), src/wx_gui.c (1.24): Fixed incorrect
	  expiration times for weather alerts.  Proper local expiration time
	  is now computed and stored.  View->WX Alerts dialog appears to
	  update correctly as alerts come and go.  Weather alert slots get
	  re-used by new alerts properly.  We might have incorrect expiration
	  times for weather alerts twice a year when daylight savings time
	  switches though.

2003-02-22 16:41  n0vh

	* src/main.c (1.232): Fixed the intensity slider since 0 was
	  causing xastir to crash.  Set the minimum to something reasonable.

2003-02-22 01:16  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.79), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.78), config/language-French.sys (1.79),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.78), config/language-Italian.sys
	  (1.79), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.76),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.81), src/main.c (1.231): Added a
	  new button the Stations menu:  Reload Object/Item History.

2003-02-22 00:58  we7u

	* src/sound.c (1.4): Adding some spacing.  No code changes.

2003-02-21 23:53  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.45), src/alert.h (1.9), src/maps.c (1.211),
	  src/wx_gui.c (1.23): Fixes to weather alerts.  Should re-use
	  weather alert slots in the array now, and should expire things
	  properly as well.

2003-02-21 20:46  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.40): Modifying the error messages to make them
	  consistent and provide useful info to the user.

2003-02-21 19:47  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.39): Taking out some commented-out code and some
	  irrelevant comments.

2003-02-21 05:10  n0vh

	* src/main.c (1.230): Logging indicator now changes color to
	  highlight that it's logging.

2003-02-21 04:31  n0vh

	* src/main.c (1.229), src/main.h (1.42): Added a status text box at
	  the bottom of the window that indicates that xastir is logging to
	  disk.

2003-02-20 23:31  we7u

2003-02-20 22:18  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.228): Changing the "Test" function a bit.

2003-02-20 20:00  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c (1.13): Changing time between receiving a new
	  bulletin and checking whether it is within our range:  From 15
	  seconds to 60 seconds.  This actually delays our getting notice of
	  each new bulletin, but helps to prevent popping up bulletins when a
	  bulletin comes in and then a posit comes in later for that station
	  (putting that station outside our range).  The cause of the bulletin
	  window popping up appears to be these inside-our-range/
	  outside-our-range-when-a-posit-comes-in bulletins.

2003-02-20 19:32  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.210): Changed/added some comments.  No code

	  More fixes for calling external programs.

2003-02-20 08:33  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.207), src/track_gui.c (1.16), src/util.c (1.59):
	  Checking for existence of external programs before trying to invoke
	  them.  If they don't exist, we call "echo" instead (relatively
	  harmless).

2003-02-20 07:56  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.43), src/wx_gui.c (1.21): Added code to clear out
	  expired weather alerts so that later alerts can use that slot.  Also
	  caused the View->Weather Alerts dialog to skip empty slots.

2003-02-20 06:47  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.30): Streamlined the ImageMagick checks.  Added
	  more comments.  Temporarily commented out the "-Ldir -llibrary"

	  areas.

2003-02-19 18:00  we7u

	* configure.ac (1.26): Making all of the MacOSX comments have
	  exactly the same spelling/case.  Easier to grep for in the future.
	  No code changes.

2003-02-19 17:35  we7u

2003-02-03 21:12  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.215): Changing max posit rate to every 60 minutes
	  instead of every 45.

2003-02-03 20:56  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.214): Added separate object/item TX timer and
	  associated slider in Configure->Defaults.  Now people with WX
	  stations that want to transmit every 5 minutes can set their
	  object/item TX rate separately.  Also changed the posit rate slider
	  to go from 0.5 to 45 minutes (30 seconds to 45 minutes).

2003-02-03 20:21  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.207), src/main.c (1.213), src/main.h (1.40),
	  src/util.c (1.52), src/xa_config.c (1.74): Separate TX timer for
	  objects and items.  New slider in Configure->Defaults for it as
	  well.  Probably needs more testing to assure that it's working
	  correctly.

2003-02-03 19:38  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.206), src/db.h (1.31), src/main.c (1.212), src/main.h
	  (1.39): Added a slider for setting the dead-reckoning timeout
	  value.

2003-02-03 19:21  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.211): Changed Configure->Defaults timing values to
	  sliders.  Makes the code much simpler plus gives the users more
	  options in setting the values.

2003-02-03 07:21  jtwilley

	* acinclude.m4 (1.3), config.guess (1.4), config.sub (1.5), missing
	  (1.5), mkinstalldirs (1.3):

	  Modified files to work with autoconf 2.53.  There are some minor
	  bugs still, but they are being worked on.

2003-02-03 07:19  jtwilley

	* COPYING (1.2): Changed example to be Y2K-compliant.

2003-02-03 05:49  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.205), src/db.h (1.30), src/draw_symbols.c (1.31),
	  src/xa_config.c (1.73): Added DEAD_RECKONING_TIMEOUT value to
	  xastir.cnf.  The function is no longer tied to the ghosting
	  interval.

2003-02-03 05:05  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.204), src/db.h (1.29), src/xa_config.c (1.72): Added
	  a global variable st_direct_timeout which is saved in the config
	  file.  This specifies the timeout value for the ST_DIRECT bit.

2003-02-02 16:42  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.203): Added comments around the ST_DIRECT bit
	  setting/clearing code.  Change the ST_DIRECT bit timeout from 1
	  minute to 1 hour.  This gives stations that transmit only every 30
	  minutes (common) a chance to be seen as an ST_DIRECT station.  As
	  the comments show in that section of code, that timeout value will
	  in the future probably change into a global variable that is set
	  within the config file.

2003-02-02 07:22  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.202): Fixed a pointer-to-integer comparison (compiler
	  warning).  Reformatted the code per Xastir project specs.

2003-02-02 04:42  jtwilley

	* src/db.h (1.28):

	  Added direct_heard variable to station data structure.  This
	  variable is set each time a direct packet is received from a
	  station.

2003-02-02 04:40  jtwilley

	* src/db.c (1.201):



	  Removed old support for direct stations and added new complete
	  direct station support.  Paths with WIDE and TRACE entries of all
	  kinds are properly checked for directness.

	  (1.27), src/interface.c (1.61), src/main.c (1.210), src/util.c
	  (1.51): Partial fixes for GUI lockups due to lots of
	  locally-controlled objects: Moved delays in interface routine so
	  that they'd only take effect if the interface was up and transmit
	  was enabled (both global and per-interface transmit controls).
	  Added a statusline() the lets us know when we're retransmitting our
	  objects/items.  Delayed transmit of our items for 30 seconds after
	  initial startup.  We will still have delays each POSIT_interval when
	  our objects get sent:  Something like 2 seconds * number of
	  up/tx-enabled interfaces * number of objects.

2003-02-01 01:04  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.30): Added code to prevent wind barbs from

2003-01-17 06:58  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.189): Temporary tweak to the ST_VIATNC code:  Changed
	  from 20 to 50 the quantity of packets required from a 'net interface
	  that will cause a reset of the ST_VIATNC bit in the station record.
	  Later this should be changed to a timer.

2003-01-15 20:12  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.199): Tweak to dead-reckoning.  Moved the
	  sec_last_dr_update variable to the main.c globals area.  This should
	  preserve the last time between runs of UpdateTime().

2003-01-15 07:46  we7u

	* src/festival.c (1.8): Added some more error checking.

2003-01-14 21:08  we7u

	* src/festival.h (1.2), src/festival.c (1.7): Fixed the non-connect
	  to Festival Server problem.  This problem existed when Festival was
	  started up after Xastir.  Now Xastir will try to connect to the
	  server when speech is desired, but will not try a new socket
	  connection any more often than every 60 seconds.

2003-01-14 17:19  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.195): Print a warning in draw_geo_image_map() if

	* src/db.c (1.185), src/interface.c (1.56), src/interface.h (1.17),
	  src/main.c (1.196): Added some debugging statements in the
	  extract_weather functions.  Added a new global string that holds the
	  last packet processed by file read or channel_data functions.  If a
	  segfault occurs, this last packet is dumped to STDERR along with the
	  segfault message.  This might help in the future to find "killer"
	  packets.

2003-01-12 16:22  we7u

2002-12-31 21:57  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.27), src/maps.c (1.191), src/util.c (1.48):
	  Speeding up get_line again (don't need all the filtering anymore

2002-12-29 23:04  rzg

	* README.1ST (1.46), help/help-English.dat (1.33): Round 1 of
	  "pre-release" changes: Reorganized and cleaned up README.1ST,
	  updated some portions as needed. Updated helpfile for map chooser
	  changes.

	  Still need more README work, especially doing something with all
	  that security stuff and perhaps the OS specific stuff. And the
	  helpfile "Whats new" needs to be written more nicely, I started but
	  ran out of time.

2002-12-28 23:41  kd6zwr

	* src/maps.c (1.189): Changed the sscanf fix... cleared the string
	  to all nulls before sscanf.  The temp string broke solaris...
	  *sigh*.  This works everywhere now??

2002-12-28 20:55  kd6zwr

	* src/maps.c (1.188): Added a temp string to avoid a sscanf bug(?)
	  to prevent junk showing up in the map chooser window.

2002-12-27 22:18  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.47): Fixing tabs in util.c:get_line().

2002-12-27 20:54  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.187): Looking for control characters in the routine

	  index.

2002-12-27 19:53  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.186): More error-checking w.r.t. map indexing.

2002-12-27 01:09  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.185): Checking for control characters as we're
	  saving the map_index data to disk.

2002-12-27 00:33  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.184): Looking for all control characters instead of
	  just '\r' or '\n'.  Added another warning message if control chars
	  are found.  Changed some comments.

2002-12-25 15:32  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.26), src/main.c (1.193), src/maps.c
	  (1.183): Added error checking at the points where different
	  xbitmap files were being loaded, and where symbols.data is loaded.
	  Xastir will now output an error message before croaking if these
	  files are not present.

2002-12-25 01:26  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.182), src/util.c (1.46): More filtering changes in

	  Map Chooser problem.

2002-12-24 22:27  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.181): Commenting out debug printf statements.

2002-12-24 20:00  we7u

	  to STDOUT if control characters other then '\n' are found in
	  map_index.sys.

2002-12-23 08:16  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.178): Initial implementation of the draw_filled
	  flag in the map drawing routines which can make use of it.

2002-12-22 19:24  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.177): Deleting dead code.  Adding comments.  Set a
	  pointer to NULL after calling a routine that might free the memory
	  space.

2002-12-22 18:54  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.176): Changed function which reads map_index.sys in
	  from disk so that it forces a sorted order for in-memory map list.

2002-12-22 07:29  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.175): More error-checking while creating map
	  indexes.

2002-12-21 16:25  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.174): Added comments.  Changed a few compares to
	  read better.  No real code changes.

2002-12-21 16:08  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.173): Added more error-checking and debug output to
	  the map indexing routines.

2002-12-21 08:27  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.192), src/maps.c (1.172): Fully functional automaps
	  selection from the Map Chooser->Properties dialog.

2002-12-21 08:08  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.191): More automaps stuff.  Can now tweak the value
	  in the map_index.sys file from the Map Chooser->Properties dialog.
	  Back-end code still has to be written to use this information.

2002-12-21 07:46  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.190), src/maps.c (1.171), src/maps.h (1.16): Adding
	  automaps enable/disable to the Map Chooser->Properties dialog.  More
	  to do yet.

2002-12-21 06:38  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.170): Added some debug lines.

2002-12-21 05:40  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.189): Moved some of the widgets to the bottom
	  rowcol form in the Map Properties dialog.

2002-12-21 01:18  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.188), src/maps.h (1.15): Map Chooser->Properties
	  now brings up new dialog which allows setting map layers and
	  draw_filled fields.  draw_filled is not used yet in the code.

2002-12-20 20:59  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.66), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.65), config/language-French.sys (1.65),

	  (1.66), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.63),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.67), src/main.c (1.187): Changed
	  to Dirs/Maps Selected in map chooser instead of just files.

2002-12-20 20:36  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.169): Added some comments.

2002-12-20 20:07  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.186): Changing the manual map index button back to
	  its original code, where it only updates the map index instead of
	  re-indexing from scratch.  This keeps the manually-tweaked map_level
	  & draw_filled fields intact.  The original reason for starting from
	  scratch was to remove deleted maps.  This happens anyway after two
	  Xastir restarts, so starting the list from scratch isn't really
	  needed anyway.

2002-12-20 19:52  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.168): Fixes to re-indexing so that files and
	  directories get good default values in the index.

2002-12-20 19:52  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.185): New stuff having to do with Map Chooser
	  Properties button.  Not fully implemented yet.

2002-12-20 19:51  we7u

	* src/maps.h (1.14): Added a prototype for a function that I need
	  to use in main.c

2002-12-20 01:04  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.184), src/main.h (1.33), src/maps.c (1.167):
	  Initial attempt at sorting/drawing maps based on map layer.  It
	  works! Next step is to get some more GUI hooks for it so that the
	  user can specify which maps go on which layer, and which layers to
	  enable for drawing.

2002-12-19 20:36  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.65), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.64), config/language-French.sys (1.64),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.64), config/language-Italian.sys
	  (1.65), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.62),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.66), src/main.c (1.183): Added a
	  count of how many maps are currently selected to the map chooser.
	  Doesn't quite work the way I'd like yet, but it is useful.  It shows
	  how many maps are marked in the in-memory map index as selected.
	  That quantity can change when you tweak things in the map chooser
	  and then hit OK.

2002-12-19 06:03  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.64), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.63), config/language-French.sys (1.63),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.63), config/language-Italian.sys
	  (1.64), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.61),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.65), src/main.c (1.182),
	  src/maps.h (1.13): More tweaks to the Map Chooser.  Fully
	  resizable now.  Add new button at the top which will eventually be
	  used to change map properties.  Changed how the "None" button works,
	  and renamed it to "Clear".

2002-12-16 07:56  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.166): Yet another attempt to clean up garbage that
	  some people are seeing in the map index.  In this tweak I check the
	  sscanf call to make sure that the proper number of fields have been
	  parsed from each input line.  If not, that record in the map_index
	  is dropped.

2002-12-16 07:07  we7u

	* README.1ST (1.45): Tweaks by Tate, KC7ZRU.  Thanks!

2002-12-16 07:03  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.181): Changed map re-indexing button so that it
	  deletes the entire in-memory index, then re-creates it from scratch.
	  It is slower than the old method, but guarantees that deleted/added
	  maps will show up in the map chooser without have to restart Xastir
	  to do it.

2002-12-16 05:41  we7u

	* src/festival.c (1.5): Change to some debug code.

2002-12-16 02:28  we7u

	* src/festival.c (1.4): Now doing a check in the festival code for
	  duplicate strings.  Only one string is held in the queue for 30
	  seconds.  If the same string comes in, festival refuses to speak it.

2002-12-15 07:00  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.63), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.62), config/language-French.sys (1.62),

	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.64), src/main.c (1.180),
	  src/main.h (1.32), src/xa_config.c (1.60): Added an "Expand
	  Directories" button to the map chooser.

2002-12-15 05:34  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.179), src/maps.c (1.165): Better implementation of
	  map directory select/de-select in the Map Chooser.

2002-12-14 23:04  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.164): A few small tweaks to how map_index strings
	  get created for directories.

2002-12-14 08:16  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.178): Commented out a couple of debugging
	  statements.

2002-12-14 07:52  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.177), src/maps.c (1.163): First functional version
	  of Map Chooser where clicking on a directory will select all maps
	  below it.  Still a few bugs left to squash, but it works!

2002-12-14 06:35  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.162): Finished getting map directories to show up
	  properly and in sorted order in the Map Chooser.  They're selectable
	  as well.  Still have to write the code to recurse through these
	  directories when selected/de-selected.  Not fully functional yet.

2002-12-14 01:04  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.161): Starting to implement storage of map
	  directories in the map index.  Not complete yet.

2002-12-13 20:04  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.176): Tweaks to comments.

2002-12-13 17:42  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.175): Including Chris Bell's new routines for
	  directory-at-a-time map file selection.  These routines are not
	  integrated into Xastir yet.  They need to be tweaked to fit into the
	  new map_index method of map selection, and the Lesstif/Motif
	  functions need to be combined into one function.  This is a work in
	  progress.

2002-12-10 22:51  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.183): Fix for dead-reckoning for compressed
	  objects/items.

2002-12-10 22:13  we7u

	* FAQ (1.11): Added a note about the missing freetype library
	  during linking.

2002-12-10 21:52  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.62), config/language-English.sys

	  (1.62), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.59),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.63), src/main.c (1.174): Added a
	  new "Re-index Maps" button to the configure menu.  Useful for those
	  instances where you've added a new map but don't want to restart
	  Xastir in order to start using it.

2002-12-10 21:15  we7u

	* README.1ST (1.44): Added a note about James Jefferson's nice
	  world map in Shapefile format.

	* src/main.c (1.173): Fixed to map chooser.  Changes now apply only
	  to the in-dialog list until/unless the OK button is pressed.  If
	  Cancel or any other button is pressed, the changes do not take
	  effect or get written to the selected_maps.sys disk file.

	  (1.160), src/maps.h (1.12), src/util.c (1.45): Tweaks to help fix
	  buffer overflows in several areas of the code.  Some of them may
	  have been caused by get_line() in util.c, which has been rewritten
	  to prevent overflowing the string passed into it.  Also added a new
	  define: MAX_FILENAME, which is used to declare sizes of char arrays.

2002-11-26 01:10  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.179), src/db.h (1.24): Start of trying to fix

2002-11-19 00:25  francais1

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.23), src/main.c (1.165): Added call to
	  draw_symbols in UpdateTime at least every 30 s if dead reckoning
	  drawing is turned on.  Tweaked dead reckoning graphics to draw the

2002-11-15 02:02  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.40): Code to handle disowning of object that other

	  retransmitting the objects when Xastir restarts.

2002-11-15 00:25  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.163), src/util.c (1.39), src/util.h (1.12): More

2002-11-14 23:50  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.174), src/util.c (1.38), src/util.h (1.11): The start
	  of code to allow disowning an object that someone else is assuming
	  control over.  Xastir already does this while running, but it
	  doesn't write the data to the object.log file, so when it starts up,
	  it owns the object again.

2002-11-14 22:07  we7u

2002-11-13 23:31  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.158): Forcing terraserver map extents in the index
	  to be at the edges of the earth.  Added more statusline messages for

2002-11-13 22:13  we7u

2002-11-13 20:40  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.170), src/interface.c (1.53), src/main.c (1.160),
	  src/main.h (1.25): Implemented a countdown from when GPS data
	  goes invalid.  It is decremented each time a posit occurs.  When it
	  reaches zero, posits stop.  Valid GPS data parsing will reset it
	  back to the starting count.  Also reduced the size of the tracked
	  station circles in order to more easily read the station data.

2002-11-13 02:23  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.169): Added another blue circle for tracked stations.
	  Now three concentric circles.

2002-11-13 02:17  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.168): Making a tracked station have both a yellow and
	  red circle to make it easier to see against different map
	  backgrounds.

2002-11-13 02:07  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.167), src/interface.c (1.52), src/main.c (1.159),
	  src/main.h (1.24): Added "my_position_valid" variable, initially
	  set to 1.  As soon as a GPS interface of any type is started up,
	  this variable gets set to zero, and it holds off posits.  Once the
	  first valid GPS position is parsed, this variable is again set to 1,
	  and posits proceed normally.  As Xastir comes up, interfaces are
	  brought up before the first posit, so if a GPS interface is enabled
	  on startup, no posits will occur until the first GPS posit is parsed
	  properly.  This variable could be used later to disable posits when
	  GPS data becomes unusable or stops coming in.  This feature is not
	  implemented yet though.

2002-11-12 23:23  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.166): Changed tracked stations circle from Red to
	  Yellow to make it easier for partially colorblind people to see
	  against a background of topo maps.

2002-11-12 22:56  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.165): Got rid of another bug off the buglist.  Now
	  only stations that are currently visible will be selected for
	  Station Info operations.

2002-11-12 22:15  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.158): Changed the order of startup so that map
	  indexing is completed before interfaces are brought up.

2002-11-12 18:56  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.156): Changes intended to keep variables from going
	  out-of-bounds.  I'm attempting to get more DRG-Enhanced map formats
	  working.  These changes don't quite make them work, but they do make
	  it better and catch some out-of-bounds problems.

	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.51), src/db.c (1.158), src/main.c
	  (1.150): Added an ID string to the status line for the periods
	  when no traffic is coming in.  If the ID string doesn't appear for 9
	  minutes straight, it is forced onto the statusline for a few seconds
	  in order to meet ID requirements.  This is useful for beaming an
	  Xastir image over amateur fast-scan television.  Tweaked the
	  Configure->Station callsign block so that all characters of a full
	  callsign plus SSID are displayed.  Tweaked the weather symbol
	  display code so that "   " and "..." are not taken to be a zero
	  reading.

2002-10-18 22:42  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.150): Changes in the GNIS map-reading code to
	  accomodate the lack of consistency in how the GNIS files are
	  formatted.

2002-10-18 21:04  we7u

	* README.1ST (1.30): Added a note from Chris about GNIS file.

	  Stations menu into submenus.

2002-10-18 17:13  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.148): Set default ON for new togglebuttons on
	  stations menu.

	  station/object display filtering.  What is coded so far works, but
	  most of the variables are not saved in the config file yet.  May
	  need more togglebuttons & variables implemented yet.

2002-10-17 22:41  we7u

	* AUTHORS (1.6): Minor cleanups and added a few contributors.

2002-10-17 22:23  we7u

	* README.1ST (1.29): Move "Previous Install Notes" section to a
	  later point in the file.

2002-10-17 22:05  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.156): Tweaks to get rid of compiler warnings for
	  Debian/S390.  Changed char's to int's and got rid of some casts.

2002-10-17 19:13  we7u

	* config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.42): Changes by David Quental,
	  CT1DRB.

2002-10-16 21:10  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.155): Added draw_symbol_filtered() function.  Will
	  eventually add code to this function which implements display
	  filtering.

2002-10-15 21:28  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.154), src/draw_symbols.c (1.16), src/draw_symbols.h
	  (1.5): Implemented different colors for tropical storm/depression
	  and hurricane packets, for the three different wind speeds:  Green =
	  gale force wind radius, yellow = tropical storm wind radius, red =
	  hurricane wind radius.

2002-10-15 20:38  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.153): Converted storm circles from nautical miles to
	  miles before calling draw_pod_circle.  Ranges are now correct.
	  Added a couple of comments as well regarding things yet to be done.

2002-10-11 23:25  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.29): Added a comment about Dallas rain gauge.

2002-10-11 19:55  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.152): Initial attempt at drawing circles around storm
	  objects (radius of winds).  Need to convert from nautical miles to
	  miles and perhaps change to a different method of drawing, but this
	  works for now.

2002-10-11 19:54  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.28): Commented out a debug line.

2002-10-11 19:53  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.15): Added some comments.

2002-10-10 22:56  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.27): Wind speed for Dallas one-wire WX station.

2002-10-10 22:21  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.26): Correction to temperature conversion for Dallas
	  WX station.

2002-10-10 22:19  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.25): Support for wind direction for Dallas WX station
	  (using OWW daemon for the data feed).

2002-10-10 20:40  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.49): Now handle 0x00 characters in port_read,
	  for the case where the One-Wire Weather daemon ("OWW") sends them to
	  us.  Temperature from a Dallas one-wire station is now initially
	  coded and appears to be working.

2002-10-10 20:38  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.24): Changed some comments and put one message under
	  debug_level control.

2002-10-10 20:05  francais1

	* src/util.c (1.37): phg_decode was missing the phg circle radius/2
	  stuff put into phg_decode.

2002-10-10 08:48  we7u

	* src/db.h (1.23), src/wx.c (1.23): Initial support for Dallas
	  One-Wire weather station.  Xastir gets it's data from the OWW
	  server.  We currently only parse out the temperature, and it appears
	  we only do that once when the network port is brought up.  More
	  functionality to be added later.

2002-10-09 05:52  we7u

	* src/main.h (1.20), src/maps.c (1.149), src/maps.h (1.10),
	  src/track_gui.c (1.8): Fixed bug where TrackMe button didn't get
	  disabled when tracking was cleared from the menus.  Map indexing now
	  removes indexes for deleted files.  Another ImageMagick API change
	  is now handled in our code.

2002-10-09 04:32  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.47), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.46), config/language-French.sys (1.46),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.46), config/language-Italian.sys
	  (1.47), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.41),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.48), src/main.c (1.146): We now
	  check for modifier keys when the third mouse button press is
	  detected and dump out a warning message asking the user to turn off
	  the modifier keys.

2002-10-04 07:20  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.151): More correct parsing of Storm Data.

2002-10-04 00:31  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.150): Commenting out debug statements.

2002-10-04 00:29  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.149), src/db.h (1.22): The start of decoding storm
	  data.  More to do in terms of units conversion and display, but the
	  basic packet decoding is coded and working.

2002-10-03 23:06  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.148): Added a comment.

2002-10-03 18:35  we7u

	  error messages.

2002-10-03 18:25  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.145), src/maps.c (1.146), src/maps.h (1.9): Updates
	  to map indexing.  Starting to work as intended now.

2002-10-02 23:39  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.46), config/language-English.sys

	  src/maps.c (1.145), src/xa_config.c (1.50), src/xastir.h (1.16):
	  Added a Disable Raster Map togglebutton to the maps menu.  Added
	  "Indexing" text to the statusline as we're indexing maps.

2002-10-02 22:28  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.144): Changed auto_maps to use the in-memory map
	  index.  Lot's of tweaks to sort the map index.  Now use the .geo
	  filenames instead of the http/ftp URL's.  Got rid of shx/dbf
	  filenames (using shp instead).  This got rid of the triple-drawing
	  of shapefiles that was ocurring with automaps.  Added statusline()
	  calls to all of the draw functions.

2002-10-01 17:43  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.143): Added more error output for geoTIFF's, where
	  proj may not have been installed correctly.

2002-09-30 23:50  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.31): Minor correction.  This window was
	  WAY too long when I defined 30 interfaces.  The new length is more
	  reasonable.

2002-09-30 23:06  we7u

	* src/interface.h (1.16), src/interface_gui.c (1.30), src/main.c
	  (1.143): Upp'ed the number of interface to 15.  Tweaked the GUI
	  and other portions of the code to handle whatever MAX_IFACE_DEVICES
	  is set to.  Xastir should theoretically be able to handle any number
	  of interfaces now, but it's only been tested so far up to 15.

2002-09-30 07:19  we7u

	* README.1ST (1.28): Added a note about the 24kgrid file available
	  from gisdatadepot.

2002-09-30 06:41  we7u

	* README.1ST (1.27): Added a more specific path for getting GNIS
	  datafiles.

2002-09-30 05:04  we7u

	* README.1ST (1.26): Added a few more sources of Shapefile maps.

2002-09-26 23:11  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.142): Fixes for Tigermap and GEO file segfaults.
	  Saw segfaults with Tigermaps when "wget" returned a zero-length
	  file.  These changes fix this problem.

2002-09-26 20:39  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.148): Limiting the new togglebutton to work only on
	  objects containing weather, not on all objects.

2002-09-26 20:29  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.147), src/main.c (1.142): A better logical relation
	  between the togglebuttons for the new "Display WX Object/Item"
	  button.

2002-09-26 19:39  we7u

	  barometric pressure display in inches Mercury to have two digits
	  after the decimal point.

2002-09-25 08:28  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.42), config/language-English.sys

	  (1.22), src/wx.h (1.2), src/wx_gui.c (1.16): Implemented
	  English/Metric barometric pressure for Own Weather Station dialog
	  and for Station Info dialog.

2002-09-25 07:49  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.41), config/language-English.sys

	  (1.41), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.35),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.42): Added another string for
	  weather stuff.

2002-09-24 23:49  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.141): Just adding some blank lines to delineate the
	  different functions.  More real code changes to come later.

2002-09-24 20:11  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.144): Better handling of weather stations and weather
	  objects.  We now try to parse the course/speed field _and_ the 'c'
	  and 's' fields in all cases, and can handle some of the different
	  field positions that some of the RAWS weather objects present to us.

2002-09-24 17:34  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.143): Changed wx_fuel_moisture so that a 00 reading
	  equates to 100%.

2002-09-24 06:48  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.40), config/language-English.sys

	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.41), src/db.c (1.142), src/db.h
	  (1.21): Added parsing of Fuel Temperature and Fuel Moisture for
	  RAWS weather objects, and the corresponding display in the Station
	  Info dialog.

2002-09-24 05:53  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.141): Added some comments.

2002-09-23 18:46  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.28): _Very_ minor spelling fixes.

2002-09-23 18:40  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.140): Changes to the lat/long gridlines by Thierry
	  Leconte: "Now, the code draw solid line and 3 types of dashed lines.
	  Solid line is, as previously, for equator and Greenwich meridian.
	  The 3 dashed line corespond to locator coord scheme : 1st dasher
	  line for big square (2 first letters) 2nd dashed line for the 2
	  numbers 3rd dashed line for small square (2 last letter).  Depending
	  of the zooming, the code could draw 1,2 or the 3 line types."  We
	  might wish to change the sizes of the boxes, but the ideas behind it
	  and the implementation are great!  Thanks Thierry!

2002-09-23 18:29  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat (1.27): Updates for object persistance and
	  a few more on the new features list to be documented at some point.
	  I still exist. :-)

2002-09-23 17:38  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.139), src/util.c (1.36): Fixes by Tom Russo for map
	  indexing of GNIS files and for reading in zero-length files.  Thanks
	  Tom!

2002-09-19 22:52  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.140): Changes by Thierry Leconte which make
	  degrees/minutes symbols appear in the status line, and add the
	  Maidenhead grid locator to it as well.  Small changes by we7u to
	  tweak the widths of the textfields on the status line.

2002-09-19 21:13  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.21): More changes for Peet Bros. U2K weather station
	  decoding by David L.  Norris.

2002-09-19 20:57  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.139), src/main.h (1.18), src/maps.c (1.138),
	  src/xa_config.c (1.48): Getting rid of WIN_MAP variables once and
	  for all.

2002-09-19 20:49  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.140): More careful string copying of callsigns in a
	  couple of places.  There was a possibility of overrunning the
	  destination string before.

2002-09-19 20:27  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.139): Adjusting buffer lengths to handle longer
	  packets.

2002-09-19 19:28  we7u

	* src/main.h (1.17), src/xastir.h (1.15): Change to allow u2k
	  complete record mode (long packets) to get through the decoding
	  functions.

2002-09-19 19:16  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.20): Another small tweak to rain totals for u2k.

2002-09-19 18:12  we7u

	* src/wx.c (1.19): Changes for Peet Bros. U2K weather station
	  decoding by David L.  Norris.

2002-09-19 16:32  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.137): Commenting out the map index printf's in
	  maps.c

2002-09-19 08:08  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.138): Adding new language string for TrackMe
	  button.

2002-09-19 08:03  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.39), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.38), config/language-French.sys (1.38),

	  (1.39), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.33),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.40): Added new language string for
	  TrackMe button.

2002-09-19 07:56  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.137), src/track_gui.c (1.6), src/track_gui.h (1.2),
	  src/xa_config.c (1.47): Implemented new TrackMe button on the
	  main window.  State is saved in config file so that Xastir starts up
	  in the correct mode.

2002-09-18 22:48  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.136), src/maps.c (1.136), src/xa_config.c (1.46):
	  Added more map types to the VECTOR button on map chooser.  Now
	  selects ".map", ".gnis", ".pdb", and ".shp" files.  Changed default
	  name of "winmaps.sys" file to "selected_maps.sys".  This last change
	  will only take effect on new installations, or if the winmaps.sys
	  file is deleted.

2002-09-18 21:21  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.135), src/maps.c (1.135): Map indexing,
	  saving/restoring from files.  This version is more space-efficient.
	  We could do more speedups by doing a sort and binary search through
	  the index, or using a hash.

2002-09-18 19:35  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.134): Small tweak to correct code which creates the
	  empty map index file.

2002-09-18 19:30  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.133): Killing off the saving of the map index for
	  now.  Plan on implementing a more space-efficient storage.

2002-09-18 19:17  we7u

	* src/maps.h (1.8), src/main.c (1.134), src/maps.c (1.132): Now
	  saving/restoring the map index to a file.

2002-09-18 18:41  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.133), src/main.h (1.16), src/maps.c (1.131),
	  src/maps.h (1.7), src/xa_config.c (1.45): Initial implementation
	  of map indexing, still need to save/restore the map index linked
	  list to a file.  Currently the indexing occurs _after_ the first map
	  draw, then succeeding map draws check the index which speeds things
	  up considerably.  The plan is to write the index to a file, read it
	  in _before_ the first map draw, and then re-index only when new
	  files appear or files are changed in the map directory.

2002-09-12 17:48  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.132): Added the Station Last Heard button into the
	  Sensitive enable/disable for Symbols in the menu.  It was getting
	  grey'ed out and not returning to the Sensitive state as the Symbols
	  Enable button was toggled.

2002-09-12 16:56  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.130): Fixes to draw_shapefile_map() to set a
	  default line width, for cases where specific maps are not recognized
	  later in the code.  The problem was that other areas in the drawing
	  code (probably tracklines) where causing map lines to get drawn in
	  double or triple width at times.

2002-09-10 23:35  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.129): Added a default line width setting to the
	  start of the polyline drawing portion of draw_shapefile_map().  This
	  is an attempt to get rid of the double line-widths that are
	  sometimes seen on the screen.

2002-09-10 23:14  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.138): Fixing the new track detector for the save
	  track function.

2002-09-10 22:14  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.137), src/db.h (1.20): A bit of housekeeping.
	  Renaming the TrackRow2 struct to TrackRow, since the old TrackRow is
	  now deleted from the code.

2002-09-10 19:22  we7u

	* src/db.h (1.19), src/db.c (1.136): Fixes for station track
	  storage.

2002-09-10 17:04  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.131): Creating the .xastir/tracklogs directory
	  automatically on startup.

2002-09-09 23:29  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.128): Tweak to handle parsing of newer format
	  bounding coordinates from USGS .fgd files.

2002-09-03 16:23  francais1

	  that are out of range.  We were computing the distance from our
	  station based on the destination callsign (BLNx) instead of the
	  originating callsign.

2002-08-27 22:43  we7u

	* src/util.h (1.10), src/util.c (1.33): Added higher precision

	  square.  They appear to be in the correct places now.

2002-08-15 21:27  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.paccomm (1.1): New startup file for Pac-Comm
	  TNC's with version 5.x firmware.

2002-08-15 17:22  we7u

2002-08-14 22:04  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.130): An attempt to prevent Emergency popups about
	  the same callsign from appearing more often than every 30 minutes.

2002-08-14 20:51  we7u

	* scripts/coord-convert.pl (1.5), scripts/permutations.pl (1.6):
	  Adding a blank line between user input and output lines.

2002-08-14 18:21  we7u

2002-08-14 15:49  francais1

	* src/util.c (1.32): Nasty lat/lon to/from UTM conversion bug.
	  (Wasn't referencing correct ellipsoid.) Also made last 2 characters
	  of grid square location lowercase since that seems more common.

2002-08-14 15:49  francais1

	* src/main.c (1.127): Nasty lat/lon to/from UTM conversion bug.
	  (Wasn't referencing correct ellipsoid.)

2002-08-14 00:12  we7u

	* scripts/permutations.pl (1.1): New script which will show various
	  permutations for a lat/lon or UTM input.  Eventually plan to have
	  this script write a log file containing objects so that Xastir can
	  plot each of the positions.  This will be useful in quickly
	  determining which of the formats is within the area of interest.
	  Developed this for Search & Rescue applications.

2002-08-13 23:51  we7u

	* scripts/coord-convert.pl (1.4): Added a range check for the
	  Easting value.  Not exact, but better than nothing.

	* src/db.c (1.128): Commenting out debug statement.

2002-08-13 20:47  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.127): Fixed Mic-E decoding problem having to do with
	  position ambiguity.  We have to specifically test for 'L' in the
	  destination field as it doesn't match the general bit patterns.
	  Stupid spec anyway.

2002-08-13 18:39  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.126), src/db.h (1.18), src/draw_symbols.c (1.14),
	  src/draw_symbols.h (1.4): Severe storm objects by Gerry Wheeler,
	  KG4NBB.  Dale Huguley, KG5QD's weather server (on the 'net)
	  generates severe storm objects and boundaries based on NWS data.
	  These objects are now decoded and drawn by Gerry's new code
	  additions.

2002-08-13 00:03  we7u

	* scripts/Coordinate.pm (1.1), scripts/coord-convert.pl (1.1),

2002-08-09 06:33  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.31), src/util.h (1.9), src/wx.c (1.18): Changes to
	  30-second timestamps in logfiles:  Now closely emulate the date/time
	  string that the date(1) command generates.

2002-08-06 23:14  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.30): Getting rid of a message that appears if the
	  .xastir/config/object.log file doesn't exist.

2002-08-06 20:42  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.37), config/language-English.sys

	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.39), src/main.c (1.126): Added a
	  clear button for the object/item history file.

2002-08-06 20:00  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.125), src/util.c (1.29), src/util.h (1.8),
	  src/xastir.h (1.14): Implementation of persistent objects/items.
	  Each new, deleted, or moved object/item is logged to
	  "~/.xastir/config/object.log".  This file is read in and each line
	  processed on startup.  This will also show tracklines for moved
	  objects as each change is logged to the file.

2002-08-06 18:33  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.125): Adding "AA:" to the beginning of auto-response
	  messages.

2002-08-06 16:52  francais1

	* src/maps.c (1.114): IsPseudoClass in ImageMagick 5.3.1 doesn't
	  quite act like I would have thought.  Changed to different check.

2002-08-05 22:29  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c (1.15), src/view_message_gui.c (1.9): More
	  tweaks regarding fonts.  Seems we can set foreground color but not
	  background on a couple of widgets.  Trying to set background color
	  causes a segfault.

2002-08-05 22:07  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c (1.14), src/view_message_gui.c (1.8): Move
	  segfault fixes in new code.

2002-08-05 22:05  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c (1.7): Fix for segfault in newly
	  introduced code.

2002-08-05 20:48  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c (1.5), src/draw_symbols.c (1.13),
	  src/location_gui.c (1.2), src/main.c (1.124), src/messages_gui.c
	  (1.13), src/track_gui.c (1.5), src/view_message_gui.c (1.6),
	  src/xastir.h (1.13): Added defines for foreground and background
	  font colors.  This and the associated code changes should help to
	  alleviate the problem where font colors would accidentally change
	  during runtime due to color-ls being run in the starting Xterm.

2002-07-26 16:35  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.26): Very minor changes to the new
	  scripts section.

2002-07-26 16:30  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c (1.11): Commenting out some debug messages.

2002-07-26 03:29  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.124), src/igate.c (1.10), src/igate.h (1.2),
	  src/main.c (1.123): Implemented SENT and HEARD queues for
	  igating->RF.  Dupes are now eliminated.  This includes if another
	  igate beat us to getting a packet on RF:  In that case we don't add
	  to the traffic on RF by sending it out too.

2002-07-24 19:58  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.123): Fix for igating:  We were testing the ST_VIATNC
	  flag for a station first to see if it had been heard via a TNC
	  interface.  This flag gets reset if the last 20 packets were heard
	  from non-TNC interfaces.  We now check the heard_via_tnc_last_time
	  timestamp to see if it's nonzero.  This timestamp does _not_ get set
	  to 0.  The code in heard_via_tnc_in_past_hour() should work better
	  for igating now.

2002-07-23 22:04  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.29), src/xa_config.c (1.44): Changing
	  txtail default value to from 10ms to 30ms.  Should be proper for
	  1200 baud.

2002-07-23 21:37  we7u

	* README.1ST (1.21): Added Lindows to the list.

2002-07-23 21:27  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.48), src/interface.h (1.15),
	  src/interface_gui.c (1.28), src/xa_config.c (1.43): Turned "Full
	  Duplex" KISS parameter into a togglebutton.

2002-07-23 20:43  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.47), src/interface.h (1.14),
	  src/interface_gui.c (1.27), src/xa_config.c (1.42): Added TxTail
	  parameter to the KISS properties dialog.

2002-07-23 20:07  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c (1.10): Putting more debug messages under
	  debug_level control.

2002-07-23 02:41  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat (1.24): Added mention of RELAY digipeating
	  and fixed a formatting thing.

2002-07-22 18:08  we7u

	* configure (1.10), configure.in (1.10): Bumping it to version
	  1.1.3.  Getting ready for another development release.

2002-07-22 17:41  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.122), src/interface_gui.c (1.26): Commenting out
	  debug message.  Making Relay Digipeat togglebuttons insensitive
	  until the code to implement them is functional.

2002-07-20 07:44  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.121): Don't relay from KISS interface if transmit for
	  that interface is turned off.

2002-07-20 07:31  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.25): Changes to make RELAY digipeat
	  insensitive when transmit is disabled for that interface.

2002-07-20 06:50  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.46): Commenting out another debug statement.

2002-07-20 06:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.45): Fixes to AX.25 interfaces that were
	  broken earlier by KISS TNC changes.

2002-07-20 00:02  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.44): Changes to serial lockfiles.  Now closes
	  port before removing lock.  Attempts to close port and remove lock
	  if open fails for any number of reasons.

2002-07-19 22:19  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.43): Fixes for errant long packets.  Code had
	  the wrong number for the length of the incoming strings.

2002-07-19 20:51  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.120), src/interface.c (1.42): Found an off-by-one
	  error in incoming_data_length.  Changed a lot of comments w.r.t.
	  KISS interfaces.

2002-07-19 08:06  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.119), src/db.h (1.17), src/interface.c (1.41),
	  src/interface.h (1.13), src/main.c (1.122): More work on RELAY
	  digipeating for Serial KISS TNC interfaces.  Getting closer, but
	  this version is still non-functional.

2002-07-19 00:02  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.118), src/db.h (1.16), src/main.c (1.121): More
	  preparation for later coding of the RELAY digipeat function.  Not
	  implemented yet.

2002-07-18 23:49  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.117), src/main.c (1.120): More comments.

2002-07-18 23:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.40): Fixing another double-lock problem.

2002-07-18 23:36  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.119): Added an important comment.

2002-07-18 23:34  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.39): Fixing a double-lock problem that I
	  introduced earlier today.

2002-07-18 21:55  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.24): Adding a debug_level statement in
	  that was missing.

2002-07-18 21:47  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.23): Adding relay_digipeat stuff to the
	  AX.25 interface GUI.

2002-07-18 21:40  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.36), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.36), config/language-French.sys (1.36),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.36), config/language-Italian.sys
	  (1.37), config/language-Portuguese.sys (1.31),
	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.38), src/db.c (1.116),
	  src/interface.h (1.12), src/interface_gui.c (1.22),
	  src/xa_config.c (1.41): Preliminary code including GUI support
	  for RELAY digipeating on Serial KISS TNC interfaces.  The back-end
	  code is not implemented yet, so right now it looks pretty but
	  doesn't do anything.  The plan is to add similar support for AX.25
	  kernel interfaces.  Regular serial TNC interfaces and NET interfaces
	  don't need this capability.  For regular serial TNC's RELAY
	  digipeating is turned on/off in the config file for that interface.

2002-07-18 20:01  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.23): Removed the serial port settings
	  from the Serial KISS TNC descriptions.  The port is set to 8N1 by
	  default now and cannot be changed.

2002-07-18 19:59  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.21): Changed interface properties dialog
	  when dealing with Serial KISS TNC interfaces:  No longer is the user
	  presented with serial parameter choices which are not allowed to be
	  changed anyway.

2002-07-18 19:39  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.22): Changed KISS interface description
	  to agree with the code, which forces the N81 option for serial port
	  parameters now.

2002-07-18 19:37  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.20): Forcing KISS interfaces to N81 for
	  the serial port parameters.

2002-07-18 19:17  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.21): Just spelling fixes.

2002-07-18 19:14  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat (1.20): A few minor additions/corrections
	  to the KISS, TNC, and AX.25 interface descriptions.

2002-07-18 19:04  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.38): Added some locks where a few were
	  missing.  Added code to send the KISS parameters down to the TNC
	  when the port is first opened.

2002-07-18 17:45  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat (1.19): Updates for serial KISS TNC,
	  message paths, igate paths, and more..

2002-07-18 16:31  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.115), src/db.h (1.15), src/interface.c (1.37),
	  src/interface.h (1.11), src/interface_gui.c (1.19), src/main.c
	  (1.118), src/messages_gui.c (1.9): Reorganized KISS parameter
	  widgets in the dialog.  Changed to string,length instead of relying
	  on the terminating zero in the string for transmitting strings.
	  This is due to the fact that KISS packets can have 0x00 in them as
	  data.  Fixed the problems with non-posit packet transmission and the
	  Serial KISS TNC interface.

2002-07-18 01:01  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.36), src/interface.h (1.10),
	  src/interface_gui.c (1.18), src/xa_config.c (1.40): Added kiss
	  parameters to the properties dialog.

2002-07-17 23:17  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.117): Better behaved positioning of dialogs.  They
	  won't get positioned quite as far down the screen now.

2002-07-17 23:06  we7u

	* src/igate.c (1.9): Reformatted all of the igating routines.
	  Added a specific check so that we don't re-inject TCPIP or TCPXX
	  packets back into the internet (we don't want looping).  The
	  routines are much more understandable now and should be easier to
	  maintain.

2002-07-17 20:54  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.35): Changed/added comments.  Deleted the
	  section of code in port_read() that looked for AX.25 flag
	  characters, as KISS packets should not normally contain them.  We
	  instead will try breaking apart the KISS packets based on \n and \r
	  characters.

	* src/db.c (1.114), src/db.h (1.14): Changing to unsigned char for
	  one parameter so that we can check all eight bits of each char.

2002-07-17 20:01  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.113): Lots of comment changes.  Added check code to
	  the decoding functions to look for and correct concatenated KISS
	  packets.  Currently the tacked-on packets will get deleted.  This
	  should get fixed in later revisions.

2002-07-17 19:25  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.34): Reformatted, changed/added comments.  No
	  code changes.

2002-07-17 09:04  we7u

	  src/interface_gui.c (1.16), src/main.c (1.116): Initial
	  implementation of Serial KISS TNC support.  This one is
	  receive-only.  Still have to write the code to generate the outgoing
	  AX.25 header for transmitting.  This one may be unstable yet, but
	  the instability should only affect Xastir instances with this port

2002-07-12 23:59  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c (1.7): Adding some code in preparation for

	  round-robin between the other three interfaces or select a default
	  path.

2002-07-12 19:15  we7u

	  Locator output to the Coordinate Calculator.

2002-07-12 16:52  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.111): Added mnemonics keys to the right mouse
	  button menu.  Now if you select it via the Maps menu you can still
	  navigate through it via keyboard.  Note that some of the options
	  won't work properly without a mouse pointer pointing to an object on
	  the screen, like Station Info.  For those options needing to snag
	  the mouse pointer, it appears to use whatever point the mouse
	  pointer is on (as usual).  If the pointer is outside the drawing
	  area, all bets are off.

2002-07-12 00:20  we7u

	  Bruninga's recommendations.

2002-07-11 22:46  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.103): Skipping first tracklog entry when filling in

2002-07-11 22:07  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.27): Small change to valid_path() to allow "qAC"

	  Dale Heatherington to the aprsd server for anti-looping purposes.

2002-07-11 21:45  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.102): Changed minimum length check for GGA/RMC

	  smartbeaconing help, other minor stuff.

2002-07-09 22:38  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.99): Expire code for trackpoints.  Currently uses the

	  Called from draw_trail() for each station.

2002-07-09 21:12  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.113): Now outputs warning messages for Shapefile

	  map files or which shapes within the file have problems.

2002-07-09 20:00  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.23): Searching for excessively long packets

	  src/wx.c (1.15): String lengths can be MAX_DEVICE_BUFFER length,
	  currently defined to be 4096 characters, when going into the decode
	  routines.  These are fixes to handle these long line lengths in a
	  graceful manner.

2002-07-09 03:17  rzg

2002-07-03 23:46  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.90): Found that the first trackpoint was getting
	  skipped when displaying in Station Info dialog.  Fixed it.  We also
	  now look in the first tracklog point for course/speed/altitude if
	  any of these parameters are missing in the current data.  Found
	  other problems in tracklog indexing in db.c that need to be fixed
	  yet.

2002-07-03 18:22  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.88): Reverting back to old Bulletin method for now.
	  New method doesn't work right if bulletin received w/no posit, then
	  posit is received later.

2002-07-03 18:14  we7u

	* README.1ST (1.19): Added a blurb about LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable
	  being ignored when running Xastir as SUID root.

2002-07-03 18:10  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c (1.4), src/db.c (1.87): Fixed bulletins so
	  that they don't pop up if distance is zero, unless the range setting
	  is set to zero.  It was getting much too annoying the other way when
	  connected to a cached network feed.  With the new code these things
	    will cause bulletins to pop up: Distance non-zero and within range
	    setting.  Range setting set to zero.  The user can also bring up the
	  View->Bulletins dialog and it will still show the zero-range
	  bulletins in any case.

2002-07-03 16:09  francais1

2002-07-02 19:40  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.107): Tweaked TigerMap config dialog so that

	  and the dialog would be smaller/easier to use with smaller screen
	  resolutions.

2002-07-02 18:10  n0vh

	  that I can see them from xa_config.c.

2002-06-26 00:20  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.97): Initial GUI for setting SmartBeaconing
	  parameters.

2002-06-20 22:41  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.96): Adding bearing degrees to the Measure
	  function.

2002-06-20 22:23  we7u

	* src/bulletin_gui.c (1.2): We now create the View->Bulletins
	  dialog when bulletins come in.

2002-06-20 21:01  we7u

	* src/igate.c (1.5), src/interface.c (1.19), src/messages.c (1.17):
	  Added/modified some comments.

2002-06-20 19:47  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.18): Added a 250ms delay after writing each
	  waypoint.

2002-06-20 17:44  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.14): Added some notes to the waypoint creation
	  routine.

2002-06-20 17:36  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.13): Fixed problem with lower-case characters when
	  creating waypoints.

2002-06-20 00:17  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.80), src/gps.c (1.12), src/gps.h (1.2),
	  src/interface.c (1.17), src/interface.h (1.5): For those of you
	  with Garmin GPS units:  Set up the audio proximity alarm range for
	  some distance around your station and Xastir will now create
	  waypoints for each APRS station/object/item that it hears within
	  that range.  They'll appear on your Garmin map display as waypoints.
	  Enjoy! You can delete the waypoints by type.  They appear as the
	  circle with the 'X' in the middle.  You may want to change other
	  waypoints to some other type before you play with this new Xastir
	  feature.

2002-06-19 17:53  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.79): Fixed remove_leading_spaces() as it didn't work
	  at all as coded.  It liked to truncate after the first word.  Also
	  fixed some malloc sizes added recently.

2002-06-19 17:44  francais1

	* src/db.c (1.78): strlen, not sizeof

2002-06-19 00:06  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.77), src/db.h (1.9), src/list_gui.c (1.9): Additional
	  memory savings for the node_path variable in the station database.
	  Changed it to a pointer and allocate exact space for the string when
	  stored or updated.

2002-06-18 23:19  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.76), src/db.h (1.8), src/list_gui.c (1.8), src/main.c
	  (1.95): More space savings.  Turned comment into a pointer in the

2002-06-18 22:21  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.75), src/db.h (1.7), src/list_gui.c (1.7), src/main.c
	  (1.94): Changed to dynamically-allocated linked list of comment
	  strings in the station database.  This results in memory savings due
	  to no empty strings being stored for stations without comment
	  fields.  It also shows all status and comment strings that have been
	  seen for each station now in the Station Info dialog.  We'll have
	  loads of fun tracking MIC-E expansion on the internet servers now!

2002-06-18 18:55  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.8): Simplifying the logic a bit.  Same
	  general idea.

2002-06-18 18:13  we7u

2002-06-17 21:40  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.69): More comments.  Another tweak to SmartBeaconing:
	  If we've sped up a bit the code will now bring the next beacon in
	  closer (in time), instead of waiting for the next slow beacon to
	  reset to the slower interval.

2002-06-17 21:16  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.68): Added a few SmartBeaconing comments.

	* src/db.c (1.66), src/main.c (1.90): A few SmartBeaconing tweaks.
	  Commented out the experimental SmartBeaconing tweaks that caused a
	  beacon when entering/exiting stop mode.  Changed how other
	  SmartBeaconing math was done.

2002-06-17 18:42  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c (1.6): Added color-coding for
	  time-since-last-heard display.  Green for 0-29 mins, Yellow for
	  30-59 minutes, Red for 60 mins to infinity.  This is to help keep
	  track of which stations are active and which haven't been heard for
	  a while.

2002-06-17 17:16  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.65): Moved the "reversed symbol" message into a debug

2002-06-13 21:07  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.61): Final fix for trail expiring on active
	  objects/items.

2002-06-13 19:22  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.60): Fixes which check for locally controlled
	  object/item which has moved.  If it has, update the time-sorting of
	  the record and update the timestamp in the station record.  This
	  should fix the problem where an expired object, when moved, stays
	  ghosted.

2002-06-13 18:47  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c (1.6): Making Send Message dialog wide enough
	  so that spec-compliant-length messages won't wrap to a new line.

2002-06-13 18:21  we7u

	* src/alert.c (1.38), src/maps.c (1.101): Converting a few more

	  systems that don't have snprintf in their libraries.

2002-06-13 00:12  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.59): Added some notes regarding expiration of

2002-06-12 21:52  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.57), src/main.c (1.85), src/util.c (1.22): A few
	  fixes for compressed position objects/items.  Adding course/speed to
	  compressed objects/items as well.

2002-06-11 00:08  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.84): A minor tweak the position ambiguity
	  togglebuttons having to do with switching compressed mode on and

	  (1.83), src/main.h (1.11), src/xa_config.c (1.28): Moved the
	  compressed_posit togglebutton to the Configure->Station dialog.
	  Added a compress_objects_items togglebutton to the
	  Configure->Defaults dialog.

2002-06-10 22:02  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.82): Fixes to give increased resolution for lat/lon
	  when using compressed packets for objects/items.

2002-06-10 21:43  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.54), src/util.c (1.21): Fixed compressed positions so
	  that we can take advantage of the higher resolution.

2002-06-08 19:05  n0vh

	* src/xa_config.c (1.27): Added some missing #ifdef statements for
	  tigermap data in the config file

2002-06-08 01:34  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.53), src/main.c (1.81): Initial support for
	  transmitting objects/items with compressed positions.  They're not
	  displaying in the proper positions on the map yet though.

2002-06-07 20:48  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.16): Added debugging into to interface.c.
	  Changed the way that we run through all interfaces when
	  transmitting.

2002-06-07 20:42  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.20): Added support for lat/lon string conversions
	  where we have more digits after the decimal point.

2002-06-07 18:10  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.52), src/xastir.h (1.10): Bring up Locate Station
	  window if an Emergency message is received.  The operator has a
	  choice whether to center on the station or just dismiss the dialog.

2002-06-07 16:48  n0vh

	* src/main.c (1.80): Load Tigermaps prior to disk maps so disk maps
	  can be overlayed if desired.

2002-06-07 15:52  n0vh

	* src/main.c (1.79): Disable all maps now also functions with new
	  TigerMaps routines.

2002-06-07 01:40  n0vh

	  checking for message_counter to xa_config.  More efficient.  Only
	  needs to be done once when starting up.

2002-06-06 21:45  we7u

	* src/messages.c (1.15), src/xa_config.c (1.24), src/xastir.h
	  (1.9): Converted message_counter to a string.  Changed message
	  sequence numbers to be 2 characters within this range: 0-9A-Za-z.
	  This prevents lockups when messaging with APRS+ stations.

2002-06-06 21:43  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.50): Removed old code.

2002-06-06 18:00  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.20), config/language-English.sys

	  config/language-Spanish.sys (1.22), src/db.c (1.49), src/main.c
	  (1.78), src/xastir.h (1.8): Implemented satellite ack mode, where
	  the Reply/Ack protocol is used to send ack's through satellites, and
	  ack's like "ack001" are disabled entirely.

2002-06-06 17:03  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.48), src/db.h (1.6), src/messages.c (1.14): Changes
	  which implement full Reply/Ack protocol.  This should speed up
	  messaging dramatically when involved in live QSO's with the APRS
	  programs that support this protocol.  This lists currently includes
	  aprsDOS, APRS+, and Xastir.

2002-06-05 20:28  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.47), src/db.h (1.5), src/messages.c (1.13): Marking
	  timed-out messages in Send Message dialog properly.  Small changes
	  to Reply/Ack sequence numbers.

2002-06-04 23:13  we7u

	* src/messages.c (1.12), src/xa_config.c (1.23): Switching to
	  base-90 for message sequence numbers (all the way to lower-case
	  'z').  Also tweaked xa_config.c to help us avoid the message_counter
	  rollover problem.

2002-06-04 22:47  we7u

	* src/messages.c (1.11): Changed from base-91 to base-89 format for
	  message sequence numbers.  This is to avoid use of the '{' character
	  within the sequence.

2002-06-04 22:25  we7u

	* src/messages.c (1.10): Converted outgoing sequence numbers to
	  2-character base-91 encoding.  Added a trailing '}' character to
	  signify that we're Reply-Ack protocol capable.

2002-06-04 21:32  we7u

	* src/messages.c (1.9): Had to take out the '}' from the sequence
	  number as it messed things up.

2002-06-04 21:20  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.46), src/messages.c (1.8): Message sequence numbers
	  are saved through restarts now.  Added more comments.

2002-06-04 20:27  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.45): Changed several comments.  Decoding of Reply/Ack
	  protocol (free-ride ACK's) is now tested and working.  This really
	  speeds up live messaging.  When encoding of the free-ride ACK's is
	  implemented as well it'll speed up messaging even more.

2002-06-04 00:50  rzg

	* README.1ST (1.16), help/help-English.dat (1.12): Updates for
	  tigermap changes and minor bits I missed in the previous update.

	* src/db.c (1.44): Minor changes to Reply/Ack's.

2002-06-03 20:14  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.43): The beginnings of Reply/Ack protocol decode.
	  Not fully tested.  Encode not implemented yet.

2002-06-03 16:45  francais1

	* src/maps.c (1.99): Fixed up imagemagick_options struct a bit.
	  Removed some imagemagick_options stuff from draw_tiger_map because
	  it is not being setup since there is no .geo file.  Fixed
	  draw_tiger_map intensity/levels bug.

2002-06-03 16:21  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.98): Changing some line widths and colors back to
	  what we had before the weekend.  We're not trying to duplicate the
	  TigerMap servers colors or look-and-feel.  We need more subdued
	  colors so that symbols and tracks show up better on top of the maps.
	  The line widths are necessary in order to more quickly identify
	  major roads without having to rely only on color.

2002-06-03 16:18  francais1

	* src/maps.c (1.97): Removed extraneous ifdef

2002-06-03 15:38  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.11): Fixes for decoding GPS NMEA sentences where

	  I made display of tigermaps a separate subroutine.  This should
	  probably be done with some of the other items in draw_geo_image_map

	  protocol (on the receive side only).  Only implemented for APRS
	  messaging, not UI-View messaging.

2002-05-31 21:24  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.41): Fixes for last_ack timer.  We now refuse to send

	* src/db.c (1.39), src/util.c (1.18): Fixed spelling error in
	  util.c.  Fixes for incorrect sorting in Send Message window for the
	  case where the remote client has restarted and is re-using sequence
	  numbers: Xastir will now replace the older messages in the database
	  and update the timestamp, which keeps the proper ordering for a QSO.
	  Messages older than 8 hours with the same text will also get
	  replaced and get a new timestamp.

2002-05-21 19:02  we7u

	* src/messages_gui.c (1.5), src/db.c (1.36): Fixes for text
	  corruption in Send Message window.  Needs further testing.

2002-05-21 17:19  we7u

	* src/util.c (1.17), src/view_message_gui.c (1.4): Fixing distance
	  calculation such that it returns 0.0 if we haven't heard a posit
	  from the remote station yet.

2002-05-21 16:18  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c (1.3): View->Messages history dump now
	  obeys the distance limit set at the top of the form.

2002-05-20 21:49  we7u

	* src/view_message_gui.c (1.2), src/xa_config.c (1.20): We now dump
	  all currently active messages out to the view->messages window when
	  it's first opened.  Different format, but still useful.  The format
	  is easily tweaked later.  Also changed the default
	  VIEW_MESSAGE_LIMIT to 10000.  This can be tweaked by the user in the
	  ~/.xastir/xastir.cnf file.  Max allowed by the code is now 99999.

2002-05-18 07:06  kd6zwr

2002-05-17 22:26  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.35): Quick check for a zero time in the message
	  database.  If found, fill in with current time and print out a
	  warning.

2002-05-17 21:14  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.34): Only cause a Send Message dialog update on the
	  first ack.  Subsequent ack's cause no update.

2002-05-17 18:37  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.33): Update message windows only when the first
	  message or the first ack comes in, or when the message doesn't match
	  the same sequence number message already stored.  This helps to
	  reduce flashing of the messages windows due to multiple copies of
	  ack's/messages being received.

2002-05-17 07:01  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.32): Changes to eliminate dupes in Send Message

	  yet, but doesn't break functionality either.

2002-05-16 16:38  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.9), src/interface_gui.c (1.11): Fixes for Mac OS X
	  (no strptime call), and for non-linux systems.  The "Set System
	  Clock from GPS Data?" togglebutton should be grey'ed out now for
	  non-linux systems.

2002-05-15 03:26  rzg

	* help/help-English.dat (1.11): Updated/rewrote .geo section for

2002-05-10 22:50  we7u

	* src/messages.c (1.5), src/messages.h (1.2): Slightly better
	  timing of messaging.  Also free's up the queue after a message times
	  out.  More work to be done.

2002-05-10 22:22  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.27): Added some notes about a bug in messaging.

2002-05-10 15:08  francais1

	* src/db.c (1.26), src/main.c (1.72), src/messages.c (1.4),
	  src/messages_gui.c (1.2): Messaging in the Send Message dialog
	  are now sorted by time.  The window is also resizable now in both
	  directions.  The 5-second update of the window has been replaced by
	  code which updates the window whenever new messages arrive.

2002-05-09 23:34  francais1

	* src/maps.c (1.88): Fixes for older imagemagick versions.

2002-05-09 22:29  francais1

	  src/maps.c (1.87), src/maps.h (1.6), src/xa_config.c (1.19): Sped
	  up drawing of DirectColor images on a DirectColor screen.  It was
	  very slow because it called XAllocColor for every pixel in a jpeg.
	  It now uses saved information on the default display visual to pack
	  the RGB into the correct bits for the pixel.  I did this because I
	  was finding some nasty color effects with the image intensity
	  settings.  I decided to leave image intensity around for geotiffs,
	  but now use gamma correction from Imagemagick for all other image
	  formats that go through imagemagick.  There can now be a gamma
	  setting in each .geo file and there is an overall adjustment which
	  will subtract or add to the individual image gamma.  While I was at
	  it, I enabled the ability to specify several of the imagemagick
	  enhancement functions in .geo files.

2002-05-09 21:31  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.70): Filling the drawing area with grey right away.
	  Gets rid of garbage that shows up on the screen sometimes when
	  starting Xastir.

2002-05-09 20:28  we7u

	* xastir.spec.in (1.10), scripts/Makefile.am (1.2),

	  directory.

2002-05-08 20:52  we7u

	* scripts/waypoint-get.pl (1.1): Here's the companion script to
	  track-get.pl.  This one will snag all of the waypoints out of a
	  Garmin GPS and create an APRS item out of each one.  The resulting
	  file can be read in by Xastir as a log file to make the waypoints
	  appear on the map screen.

2002-05-08 19:48  we7u

	* scripts/track-get.pl (1.2): Added another message at the end.

2002-05-08 19:38  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.25), src/main.c (1.69), src/main.h (1.9): Fixes for
	  some compiler warnings, by Chris Bell, KD6ZWR.

2002-05-08 19:04  we7u

	* scripts/track-get.pl (1.1): New Perl script which can fetch the
	  tracklog from a Garmin GPS, then create a log file which can be read
	  by Xastir.  Read in the log file and you'll have a track on Xastir's
	  map screen.  Needs tweaks to Xastir in order to view more than 100
	  points of the track at a time.

2002-05-08 05:45  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.86): GNIS code fixes by Chris Bell, KD6ZWR.

2002-05-07 18:40  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.68), src/maps.h (1.5): Xastir will now do a PNG
	  snapshot every time the "Enable PNG Snapshots" button is re-enabled.
	  This beats waiting 5 minutes for the next snapshot while you're
	  experimenting with things.

2002-05-07 05:19  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.85): First implementation of Point-type Shapefiles.
	  Seems to work fine so far.

2002-05-06 23:04  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.24): Reformatting a warning message to make sure that
	  we only output printable chars to STDOUT.

2002-05-06 22:01  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.23), src/util.c (1.16): Fixes for AEA formatted
	  headers.  They now should get converted properly to TAPR-2 style
	  headers.  What was missing was the re-arranging of the callsigns in
	  the header to the correct order.

2002-05-06 00:53  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.84): Changing default color for pedestrian trails,
	  used if later code doesn't set the color explicitly.

2002-05-04 16:55  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c (1.18): Another tweak to limits checking.

2002-05-04 05:38  we7u

	  Cranked the width down a bit too.

2002-05-03 19:14  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.79): Setting up more default colors.  Pedestrian
	  trails are now red.  Dashed lines for trails, 4WD roads, ferry
	  crossings.  Glaciers are now white.

2002-05-03 17:22  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.78): Getting rid of compiler warning by adding
	  "color.h" as an include file.  This is needed for the
	  GetPixelByName() call I added.

2002-05-03 16:57  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.77): Cleaning up properly with warning message for

	* src/maps.c (1.76): This ones for Ken:  Download and select plc00
	  files from GeographyNetwork to get the "designated places"
	  boundaries filled in with PaleGoldenrod color.  The code will also
	  label these areas.  Create the following subdirectories to get the
	  layering right:

	      county (cty00)
	      designated_places (plc00)
	      h2o (lkH and wat)
	      misc (lkC)

	  Shapefiles.  Changed the county polygon back to gray so that tracks
	  show up better.

2002-05-02 19:28  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.73): Added comments.  Made some optimizations in
	  the Shapefile code.  Shortened some labels that get drawn.

	  zoom levels with Shapefiles.

2002-05-01 22:12  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.71): Optimization: Only doing floating point
	  operations for label rotation when we know we're going to be drawing
	  the label.  Changes by Chris Bell to help alleviate upside-down
	  labels.

2002-05-01 21:23  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.70): Rotated labels for Shapefile maps.  This be a
	  good thing!

2002-05-01 19:11  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.69): Better label drawing.  Quantities of identical
	  labels drawn in the viewport are now determined by zoom level.

2002-05-01 00:08  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.22): Fixing directed query responses.  They now show
	  up in a popup window.

2002-04-30 22:53  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.67), src/xa_config.c (1.16), src/xa_config.h (1.3):
	  get_int() and get_long() now check for min/max values, and assign a
	  default value if the number is outside this range.  Also prints a
	  warning message if it has to assign the default.

2002-04-30 20:50  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.68): Changing the levels at which smaller roads and
	  labels for those roads get drawn.  All roads are drawn at zoom 64

	  Created a #define in main.h for enabling/disabling the "Transmit Raw
	  WX data" togglebutton.  The #define enabling this button is
	  commented out.  Most likely the only people interested in this
	  button would be people debugging code for certain Peet Bros. weather

2002-04-24 16:54  we7u

	* src/alert.h (1.7), src/maps.c (1.40): Speedups for weather

	  of the mouse movement was in the horizontal or in the vertical
	  direction, then computes the new zoom level based on that.  Previous
	  to this change zooming was calculated based only on vertical
	  movement.

	  Cancel buttons will dismiss the dialog.

2002-04-04 06:56  we7u

	* src/maps.c (1.10): First attempt to make Shapefiles more

	  src/interface_gui.c (1.7), src/xa_config.c (1.8): Added KD6VPE's
	  changes to add tenth/hundredth rain gauge types to the weather
	  interfaces.  This is to support the two types of rain gauges for
	  Peet Brothers weather stations.  This patch implements a global
	  variable and the interface widgets needed to manipulate it, but does
	  _not_ implement the code to do anything with the variable yet.

2002-03-30 18:00  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.31): Changed Coordinate Calc help text so that it
	  is obviously not good output data.

	* src/alert.c (1.3): There were several strncpy's without a
	  following str[last] = `\0` statement.  One of them caused a
	  segfault.  This whole file probably needs looking over for such
	  problems.  I fixed a few I thought need the statement or in the case

2002-03-28 18:27  francais1

	* src/main.c (1.19): Commented out code that clears mouse pointer

	  we may be trying to write down that information in another window or
	  some such action.

2002-03-28 00:54  francais1

	* src/db.c (1.11), src/main.c (1.18), src/util.c (1.9),

2002-03-27 18:21  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.9): Fixed a problem caused by the mass update to new
	  debug levels:  The station callsign was truncated in Station Info
	  dialog if in debug level that wasn't 0 or 1.  Also changed this
	  dialog such that the characters which make up the symbol are always
	  visible between the symbol and the callsign, whether in debug mode

	  Currently this only modifies the status bar display.  Only three of
	  the four options are currently implemented.

2002-03-26 23:43  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.aea (1.2), config/tnc-startup.sys (1.4): Added
	  "echo off" to two tnc startup files.  This prevents echo'ed commands
	  from showing up in the middle of tnc data.

2002-03-19 05:25  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.pico (1.6): Changes hinted at by Jeff Brenton,

2002-03-11 23:36  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.kam (1.3), config/tnc-startup.kpc3 (1.3),
	  config/tnc-startup.sys (1.3): Changed "mfilter off" to "filter
	  off" for kam and kpc3.  Added "filter off" to tnc-startup.sys as
	  well.  Both mfilter and filter are in that file, making it work for
	  both types of TNC's.

2002-03-11 20:53  we7u

	* src/lang.c (1.3): Added a bit of bulletproofing for lang.c.

2002-03-11 18:06  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.kam (1.2), config/tnc-startup.kpc3 (1.2),
	  config/tnc-startup.sys (1.2): Adding "mfilter off" to most tnc
	  startup files.

2002-03-11 09:17  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.12): Increased inter-character delay to 25ms.
	  PicoPacket doesn't work with 20ms.  This is only for writes on
	  serial port TNC's.

2002-03-11 08:06  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.pico (1.5): Fullduplex not recognized by my
	  PicoPacket.  Fulldup is.

	  picopacket startup file.

2002-03-07 20:58  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.8): Changed a few variables to globals.  This is to
	  allow two different GPS sentences to update the current info, then
	  perform a screen update using the combined data.  Fixed the code so
	  that receipt of one valid GPS sentence doesn't disable decoding of
	  the next.

2002-03-07 20:49  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.pico (1.3): Swapped the order of the GPS
	  string captures.

2002-03-07 20:49  we7u

	  Tested.

2002-03-07 18:55  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.8): Added a delay after sending each init
	  string to a serial TNC.  This is needed to allow the TNC enough time
	  to process the command before sending the next.

2002-03-07 16:58  we7u

	* Makefile.am (1.4): Adding a backslash that was erroneously
	  deleted from Makefile.am.  Thanks to Jack Twilley for pointing this
	  out.

2002-03-07 01:02  we7u

	* config/Makefile.am (1.2), config/tnc-startup.pico (1.1): Added a
	  startup file for a Paccomm PicoPacket.

2002-03-06 23:58  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.7): Setting the time from GPS data now requires only
	  that a $GPRMC string be received, the OS be Linux, and that the
	  Xastir binary must be SUID root.  It no longer requires the $GPGGA
	  sentence to set the time.

2002-03-06 21:57  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys (1.4), config/language-English.sys
	  (1.4), config/language-French.sys (1.4),
	  config/language-German.sys (1.4), config/language-Italian.sys
	  (1.4), config/language-Spanish.sys (1.4), src/main.c (1.11):
	  Changed 20 & 10 second GPS update rates down to 15 & 5.

2002-03-06 21:13  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.8): Added station trails for the local station.
	  Improved station/trail update rate for Track-Me mode.

2002-03-06 19:48  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.7): Added the capability to track ourselves.  Uses
	  the Track Station facility, so the map moves when we get too near
	  the edge of the viewport.

2002-03-06 18:11  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.5): Added a missing mutex unlock that was
	  preventing getting to the properties dialog for the new interface
	  type.

2002-03-06 09:52  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.6): Blanking out fields for which we don't have
	  actual data values.

2002-03-06 09:44  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.7): Added else clause s.t. it changes the type
	  to "aprs data" if the nmea tests fail.

2002-03-06 09:29  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.6): A few small tweaks to tnc_get_data_type().
	  Wasn't detecting NMEA data properly.

2002-03-06 09:17  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.5): Updating local position after decoding each
	  GPRMC or GPGGA string.

2002-03-06 09:03  we7u

	* src/gps.c (1.4): Now updates local position when either $GPRMC or
	  $GPGGA are received.  Both are not required except for setting time.
	  Added #ifdef __linux__ around the settime call.

2002-03-06 08:30  we7u

	* src/interface.c (1.5): Modified tnc_get_data_type() function so
	  that it doesn't call the decode_ax25_line() function.  The latter
	  function is destructive to its first parameter, which is the APRS
	  packet.  It was causing the packet to be destroyed before it could
	  be parsed and added to the database.

2002-03-06 08:27  we7u

	* src/db.c (1.6): Corrected spelling error in debug output.

2002-03-06 08:25  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.10): Added a couple of comments.

2002-03-06 07:53  we7u

	* src/interface_gui.c (1.4): Added "Set Time" button to two more
	  GPS interfaces.  Took it away from the "Serial TNC" interface.

2002-03-06 06:42  we7u

	* src/main.c (1.9): Widening the debug_level form to handle up to

	  Changes by Owen DeLong <owen@delong.com>:  Changing to bit-mapped
	  debug levels.  Added new interface type "Serial TNC w/GPS on AUX
	  port", which is for Kantronics KAM, KPC3+, and Paccomm PicoPacket
	  TNC's that respond to <CTRL>-E for fetching GPS strings.  Added new
	  DEBUG_LEVELS file that describes the new standard levels.  Added
	  more debug statements througout the code.  Added comments for GPGGA
	  sentence.  Added "dbadd" parameter to decode_ax25_line, if it's set
	  on return, add the data to the database.  Filter "cmd:" out of
	  incoming data.  Decode time/data from GPRMC and GPGGA strings, used
	  to set system time to GPS time.  Altitude units now decoded from
	  GPGGA strings.  Changed hard-coded device numbers to ennumerated
	  values.  New black background choice.  Added "char *envp[]" to
	  parameters for main.

	  Still needed: Set time fixes for other operating systems.  Smooth
	  time transition instead of force to new value.  "Set Time" button
	  for remaining two GPS interface types.
