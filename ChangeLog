2002-01-01 22:57  kg4ijb

	* src/Makefile.am: modified ax25 macro

2002-01-01 22:57  kg4ijb

	* configure: configure rebuild

2002-01-01 22:55  kg4ijb

	* config/Makefile.in, help/Makefile.in, m4/Makefile.in:
	configure/make rebuild

2002-01-01 22:42  kg4ijb

	* Makefile.in, acconfig.h, acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, config.h.in,
	configure.in: Modified AX25 check.  Added libXp check (is this a
	OSF/Motif thing?)

2001-12-29 18:36  dk7in

	* src/db.c: 
	Weather decoding with compressed position format.

2001-12-28 13:26  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added an fseek() needed on Solaris 7.  Works fine on
	Linux too.  Fixes a Map Chooser bug:  Only one map shows up in the
	Map Chooser on Solaris.  Submitted by Chris Bell
	<cbell@junknet.com>, KD6ZWR.

2001-12-27 17:04  dk7in

	* src/db.c: 
	Correction of WX data below 0°F, submitted by Timo Pekurinen

2001-12-22 21:14  we7u

	* src/interface.c: More fixes for interfaces.  We now keep each
	allocated socket until we wish to stop or restart an interface.

2001-12-22 16:02  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Tweaks to get rid of one error, and to allow
	errored interfaces to be killed or restarted.

2001-12-22 12:58  we7u

	* src/: fcc_data.c, interface.c, interface_gui.c: Fixes to
	interfaces.  "Start All" now skips devices that are already up. 
	"Stop All" skips those that are already down.  Sockets are not shut
	down if they failed to start in the first place.

2001-12-21 21:23  we7u

	* src/main.c: Tweaks to dialog positioning.  A bit more consistent
	now.

2001-12-21 16:33  we7u

	* src/main.c: Now calling check_ports() every 7.5 minutes instead
	of 5 minutes.  This will cause an inactive port to be killed
	restarted in about 15 minutes.

2001-12-21 16:24  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Now check for DEVICE_UP before checking for
	inactivity on a port.  Changed many debug messages as well.

2001-12-21 15:40  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Commented out the statement which sets port
	status to DEVICE_ERROR on a read of zero characters from the
	socket.  This is taken care of by the inactivity timers now.  It
	was causing a problem when a nearby port was killed/restarted,
	which must have sent a signal to the read or recvfrom calls,
	thereby interrupting them and causing the port to be closed
	wrongly.

2001-12-21 15:29  we7u

	* src/db.c: Moved some of the debug output for messages to use
	"debug_level & 4".  Needed to get those messages out of the way of
	the "&2" debug output I need now.

2001-12-21 02:23  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, interface.h, interface_gui.c, main.c:
	Implemented inactivity timeouts for network sockets.  If nothing
	heard in 5 minutes, status goes red.  Another 5 minutes and a
	reconnect occurs.  Also fixed some logic involved in detecting EOF
	on sockets and broken sockets.

2001-12-20 22:12  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Upped the size of one string variable.  Added
	debugging statements.

2001-12-20 18:58  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Fixed a bug where a connect thread isn't
	terminated properly under some conditions.  Added some comments.

2001-12-20 13:14  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added more possible thread cancellation points
	for the connect thread.  Added more comments.

2001-12-20 12:35  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Got rid of another useless error message on a
	pthread_cancel() call.	Added a few more comments.

2001-12-20 12:19  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Any error from pthread_cancel means that the
	thread has already died or that we got the thread number wrong. 
	Commented out the warning messages for that case, which don't
	matter to us.

2001-12-20 12:01  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Thread functions return positive error values
	instead of negative.  Corrected IF's to compensate for this.

2001-12-20 11:48  we7u

	* src/: hostname.c, interface.c: Added more diagnostics to thread
	termination.  Added more places where the port read/write threads
	actually check for a termination request.  This is to help
	alleviate the problem where old threads don't get terminated.

2001-12-20 04:24  dk7in

	* help/: help-English.dat, help-German.dat: 
	Added a note about potential xpm map problems

2001-12-13 13:29  n7tap

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Changing inline to __inline__ should not
	confuse ANSI C compilers, but should still inline when compiling

2001-11-06 01:31  we7u

	* Makefile.am: Set up xastir/maps/filled, transparent, and
	z_overlay directories during install.  This helps with layering the
	maps in the proper order when more than one map type is selected.

	disc.

2001-11-02 01:06  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Additions/corrections by Reuven Gevaryahu,
	KB3EHW.

2001-11-01 17:05  we7u

	fixes id.

2001-11-01 15:37  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added lots of comments.  Combined common code into a
	new function: station_del_ptr().

2001-11-01 15:35  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Getting rid of the minimum 24 hour expire for
	the station database.  This will allow us to go to a 12-hour expire
	if the station-clear-from-screen limit is set to it's low of 6
	hours.	Keeps the memory used by Xastir down when hooked to one or
	more internet links (receiving lots of stations).

2001-11-01 14:34  we7u

	* src/xa_config.c: Added some comments.

	are now always circles, offset by 1/3 the radius if there's a
	favored direction.

2001-10-31 01:44  we7u

	* src/db.c: Tweaks to display_station() to keep it from ghosting
	locally-owned objects and items.

2001-10-30 20:00  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Tweaked a few comments.  Commented out a printf. 
	Trying to get windows-format embedded objects to work but no luck
	yet.

2001-10-30 12:37  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Additions/corrections by Reuven Gevaryahu,
	KB3EHW.

2001-10-30 12:31  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Getting rid of gray background for other non-rotated
	map labels.  The gray rectangle obscurs details of the map
	underneath.

2001-10-30 12:12  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Getting rid of gray background for rotated labels,
	that didn't match the rotation anyway.

2001-10-30 11:56  we7u

	* src/Makefile.in: Attempting to get rid of conflicts caused by
	adding two new files.

2001-10-30 02:46  we7u

	through the addition of rotated.h and rotated.c files.

2001-10-30 01:16  we7u

	* src/: rotated.c, rotated.h: Initial checkin of files which
	support drawing rotated label text onto the screen.

2001-10-29 04:36  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Starting to add label rotations to Windows-type APRS
	maps.

2001-10-29 03:29  we7u

	* src/db.c: Object/Items now transmit at posit rate selected in
	Configure->Defaults (third row of togglebuttons).  Fixed
	db.c:data_add() to treat objects/items differently:  It doesn't
	update the timestamp in the database for locally-owned
	objects/items when it hears them.  Xastir will cease to transmit
	the objects when they expire from the queue, which is 2 * the
	station display interval (again selected in Configure->Defaults,
	2nd row of togglebuttons).

2001-10-28 02:09  we7u

	* src/db.c: Forget a conversion from meters to feet for altitude in
	the new code.

2001-10-28 01:52  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Fully implemented repeating objects/items. 
	They will now be retransmitted at a 30 minute rate.  Currently
	either the "live" or "killed" objects/items will keep transmitting
	forever.  They won't expire from the queues because Xastir keeps
	hearing them on at least the loopback interface at a 30-minute
	rate.

2001-10-28 00:25  we7u

	* src/db.c: Small fix to allow searching for item names that end in
	one or two spaces.

2001-10-27 23:15  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, main.c, main.h, util.c: Retranmitting items and
	objects initial implemention.  Owned objects will be retransmitted
	each 15 minutes.  Currently only handles regular items/ objects,
	not signposts, area objects, or DF objects.

2001-10-27 15:50  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Fixing a bug in Configure->Defaults, missing
	a break statement.

2001-10-27 15:13  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, main.c, maps.c: Starting to implement
	retransmission of locally-owned objects/items.	Not functional yet.

2001-10-27 03:14  we7u

	* src/: draw_symbols.h, main.c, maps.c, maps.h: More messing with
	Windows-type APRS map labels and embedded objects.

2001-10-26 19:13  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added decoding of embedded objects/labels for
	DOS-format maps.  Windows- type map support of embedded objects is
	in there too, but may be incomplete yet.

2001-10-26 14:58  we7u

	* src/: bulletin_gui.c, db.c, draw_symbols.c, location_gui.c,
	main.c, maps.c, track_gui.c, view_message_gui.c, wx_gui.c: Added
	more mutex locks around some of the newer dialogs.  Added month to
	Station Info tracks.  Filter non-map files from Map Chooser
	listing.

2001-10-26 11:23  dk7in

	* scripts/mapblast2geo.pl: 
	Small modification of scaling algorithm.

2001-10-25 18:15  we7u

	* src/track_gui.c: Changed Cancel to Close on Track Station dialog
	button.  Makes more sense.

2001-10-25 15:28  we7u

	* src/locate_gui.c: Made the default button on the search dialog be
	the Locate Now! button.

2001-10-25 13:33  we7u

	* src/main.c: Removed more widgets on main window from tab group. 
	Object is to only have the drawing area in the tab group so that
	tab/back-tab won't defeat the keyboard controls for the drawing
	area.

2001-10-25 13:02  we7u

	* src/main.c: Took the measure, move, and arrow panning buttons out
	of the tab group.  This makes the zoom keys work more often without
	having to tab first to get to the drawing area.

2001-10-25 12:49  we7u

	* src/: locate_gui.c, maps.c: Implemented "Match Case" button for
	Locate Map Feature function.

2001-10-24 15:31  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Spanish.sys,
	src/locate_gui.c, src/main.c, src/maps.c, src/maps.h,
	src/xa_config.c, src/xastir.h: Nearly fully implemented
	feature-search.  Quite usable now.

2001-10-24 12:24  we7u

	* src/main.c: Getting rid of the copying of the first and second
	pixmap to the screen while generating a screen image.  Most
	machines are fast enough so that these operations just get in the
	way.  This will provide a speedup on all machines at the expense of
	seeing nothing until the operation is complete.

2001-10-24 12:01  we7u

	* README.1ST, help/help-English.dat: Additions/corrections by
	Reuven Gevaryahu, KB3EHW.

2001-10-23 17:45  we7u

	* src/: locate_gui.c, maps.c: More changes for GNIS search

	* src/: locate_gui.c, main.c, main.h, maps.c, maps.h: The start of
	a placename search feature using GNIS map data.

2001-10-21 14:49  we7u

	option.

2001-10-19 14:17  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c: Added the panning arrow buttons back onto
	the new toolbar.  Should work with real Motif now since they're not
	on the menubar anymore.

2001-10-19 13:06  dk7in

	* src/db.c: 
	Make TNC X-1J4 work

2001-10-19 12:16  we7u

	main menu so that they'll work with Motif.

2001-10-18 15:03  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Bumping total_vector_points up to 200,000 so that
	larger DOS-format vector maps can be handled.

2001-10-17 14:39  we7u

	* config/language-Dutch.sys, config/language-English.sys,
	config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,
	config/language-Italian.sys, config/language-Spanish.sys,
	src/main.c, src/main.h, src/maps.c, src/maps.h, src/xa_config.c:
	Added jpeg snapshot capability.  Xastir will automatically create a
	jpeg of the map window every 60 seconds.  Useful for web pages and
	such.

2001-10-17 13:30  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added some comments.

2001-10-17 10:58  dk7in

2001-10-14 01:00  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, maps.h: Added rudimentary print-to-file
	capability.  Currently prints to a file /var/tmp/xastir_print.ps,
	which is a rotated postscript monochrome file.	Run lpr on this
	file and you'll get a nice printout.  Eventually plan to add a
	Print Properties dialog which will allow setting sheet size, color/
	B&W, rotation, and scaling options.

2001-10-13 09:12  kg4ijb

	* acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure, m4/Makefile.in,

	rates to the Configure->Defaults menu.

2001-10-10 23:58  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, main.c: Changed interfaces to do true
	round-robin between entered paths.  Changed logging such that
	packets are always logged to net.log if enabled.  tnc.log is only
	written to if at least one interface is up (whether or not all the
	transmit buttons are enabled).	Changed Posit timing in main.c to
	something recognizable, currently 10 minutes per posit.

2001-10-10 12:33  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Fixed local logging of messages/object/items. 
	It also logs locally when transmit is disabled.  Still must fix
	posit local logging.

2001-10-10 12:03  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, main.c: Implemented signpost object
	encoding/decoding.

2001-10-10 10:35  we7u

	stations may be selected after the initial one.  This one's for
	Frank...

2001-10-10 03:56  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixed some more minor bugs with objects.

2001-10-10 02:07  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Made the Modify->Object/Item menu item drop
	through the Station Info dialog to go straight through to the
	Modify dialog.	Much nicer.  We still use the code in Station Info
	to determine which objects are closest to the mouse pointer.

2001-10-08 17:31  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added ' ' and '.' decoding to extract_speed_course(). 
	Allowed by the spec.  We change them to '\0' before we leave the
	function.  Also added a call to extract_speed_course() _after_ the
	call to extract_omni.  Seems the course and speed may come after
	DFS in example packets I've seen.

2001-10-08 16:05  we7u

	* src/main.c: Completion of DF'ing dialog for Create->Object/Item.

2001-10-07 21:01  we7u

	* src/: db.c, draw_symbols.c, main.c: Fixed a couple of bugs
	relating to corridors and Area objects.  Changed the Create/Modify
	Object dialog to be dynamic, changing to any of four different
	forms when different togglebuttons are activated.  Should be
	simpler for the user now.  This is in preparation for adding more
	options in for creating DF objects.

	successfully run ./configure.

2001-10-05 17:35  we7u

	* src/main.c: Preparations to add more dialogs for creating

2001-08-27 15:05  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changed middle mouse button to zoom out 2x WITH

	to reduce the number of screen redraws as they're moving around.

2001-08-27 14:43  we7u

	* src/main.c: A few changes to make the popup menu work with Motif.

2001-08-27 06:13  we7u

	* scripts/inf2geo.pl: Found out that the format in .inf files is
	DD.MM.MMMM, not DD.MM.SS as I had previously thought.  New code
	corrects this.

	* scripts/inf2geo.pl: Added bounds checking for lat/long numbers.

2001-08-25 14:31  we7u

	functions of left mouse button.

2001-08-25 08:32  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c: Changed mouse menus (a lot!).  Minor
	changes to maps.c regarding currently unused shapefile weather map
	stuff.	Mouse popup menu is now the right button.  Left button
	centers if you don't drag.  If you drag, it currently centers and
	zooms in by a factor of 2.  Middle button zooms out without panning
	by a factor of 2.

2001-08-24 00:31  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Added some comments that explained how path

	among the non-null entries.

2001-08-23 16:28  we7u

	possible, set up proper tab groups and default selections.

2001-08-09 15:04  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changed View->Incoming Packet Data dialog to use
	rowcolumn widget, to be resizable width-wise, and to make the tab
	groups consistent.  Tab and arrow keys can now go through the

2001-08-09 13:33  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changed Map Chooser dialog to user rowcolumn widget
	for the buttons, made the OK button the default, put all the

2001-08-07 14:15  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.kam: And again.

2001-08-07 12:40  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.kam: Again trying to fix RCS tag.

2001-08-07 12:39  we7u

	* config/tnc-startup.kam: Fixed RCS tag.

2001-08-07 12:38  we7u

	* config/: tnc-startup.kam, tnc-startup.kpc3, tnc-startup.sys:
	Changed comments only.

2001-08-01 18:35  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c: Tweaked busy_cursor calls to refer to
	appshell intead of dialogs.  This results in more consistent
	behavior.

2001-08-01 17:27  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixed RAC/FCC lookups so they are persistent through
	Station Info dialog updates.

2001-08-01 16:57  we7u

	* src/db.c: Getting rid of some tab characters that crept in from
	somewhere and correcting the indentation for those sections.

2001-08-01 03:30  we7u

2001-07-31 19:30  we7u

	* src/: db.c, interface_gui.c, location_gui.c, main.c,
	messages_gui.c: Plugging some memory leaks by calling XmStringFree
	and XtFree at appropriate places.

2001-07-31 15:49  we7u

	* src/db.c: Added compute_decorations() which figures out the size
	of the window decorations and stores it in global variables. 
	Station_data() uses this to destroy/recreate the Station Info
	dialog at the same place on the screen each time.  Note:  There
	appears to be a memory leak in popups/dialogs.	Every 30 seconds I
	see my fvwm process eat up more memory because of the Station Info
	dialog updating.

2001-07-26 20:17  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Gets rid of white lines when drawing geotiff topo
	maps at some zoom levels.

2001-07-26 18:58  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, main.c: Dynamically-updated Station Info
	dialog.  Couldn't get it to place the dialog in the same spot each
	time, due to the window decorations messing up the geometry
	returned from Motif calls.  I'll keep trying.  Window updates info
	each 30 seconds.  Henk should like this feature.

2001-07-26 13:31  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys, src/main.c: Added a "Disable PHG"
	toggle button to the Configure->Station dialog.

2001-07-26 05:01  we7u

	* src/main.c: Reduced the size of the Configure->Defaults dialog

	make them compatible with more flavors of Unix.

2001-07-25 15:18  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Small tweak to make "wget" files work across
	different users on the same machine.  Without this change the 2nd
	and later users will get permission errors while trying to use the
	same temp files in /usr/tmp.

2001-07-25 14:21  n7tap

	* src/db.c: Some tweaks to area object decoding.  1. Clear area
	object info if we get a packet for the same station that    no
	longer has the area object symbol.  2. Avoid losing "good" area
	object info if we receive a badly formatted    area object from the
	same station.

2001-07-25 12:36  n7tap

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Added code to limit the values being passed
	to the X drawing functions to 16 bit.  This is still not going to
	be completely correct for large/highly zoomed in objects, but it's
	a bit better.  For a little more info, see comment in draw_area.

2001-07-25 03:07  we7u

	* src/main.c: Moved lat_offset and lon_offset to the same order I
	had them earlier today.  Had mistakenly reversed them, but root of
	problem was actually in draw_symbols.c instead.  This is for Area
	Objects/Items.

2001-07-25 03:05  we7u

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Reversed sqrt_lat_offset and sqrt_lon_offset
	in formulas.  They were backwards.

2001-07-24 17:17  we7u

	* src/main.c: More minor fixes to Object->Modify dialog.

2001-07-24 15:59  we7u

	* src/main.c: More filling in of values for Object->Modify dialog.

2001-07-24 12:42  n7tap

	* src/db.c: Was not deleting the area object from the data
	extension field, nor the corridor width, if present.  Also, display
	distances in yards or meters below 1 mile or 1 km.

2001-07-24 04:10  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fix object and item to maximum length or less to
	avoid segfaults.  Fill in more of Object->Modify dialog with
	existing data.

2001-07-24 00:44  we7u

	* src/main.c: Set default values.  Fixed bug where repeated
	toggling of radio buttons messed up the logic.

2001-07-23 19:48  we7u

	* src/main.c: Adjusted width of input fields on Object->Create
	dialog.

2001-07-23 19:34  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixed error in offsets for area object (had them
	reversed).  Make course/ speed not available if using area objects.
	 Forced symbol to be the same as default when disabling area
	objects or signposts.

	config/language-French.sys, config/language-German.sys,

2001-07-20 12:42  n7tap

	* acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure: ImageMagick support stuff
	was using escaped backticks (\`) to get cflags, etc. which would
	make that run at compile time instead of configure time which is
	not the way most configure scripts I've looked at do it and it
	wasn't working right anyway.

2001-07-19 05:15  we7u

	* scripts/inf2geo.pl: Wasn't converte 'S' and 'W' numbers into
	negative numbers.  Fixed now.

2001-07-19 04:55  we7u

	* scripts/inf2geo.pl: Tweaked to handle a few different
	upper/lowercase letters for both the INF extension and the GIF
	extension.  Should handle .INF/.inf/.Inf and .GIF/.gif/.Gif files
	now.  Better error messages.

2001-07-18 18:57  we7u

	Converts .inf files to .geo files.

2001-07-17 17:28  n7tap

	* src/maps.c: The extension for terraserver map files is .jpg not
	.gif.

2001-07-17 13:13  we7u

	* scripts/inf-convert.pl: Minor change to imagesize.

2001-07-17 13:04  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Changing some of the limits for the WX-200 weather
	station.

2001-07-17 12:26  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Checking total_rain for out-of-bounds numbers in WX-200
	decoding, and added some notes w.r.t. wx200d and the WX-200 code.

2001-07-17 12:00  we7u

	* scripts/inf-convert.pl: First CVS version of the .INF file
	converter.

2001-07-14 20:49  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Added another out-of-range check for Dew Point and the
	WX-200 weather station.

2001-07-14 20:09  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Checking for out-of-range numbers for a few parameters
	on a wx-200 weather station.

2001-07-14 17:50  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Fixed wind gust queue so I read all 5 buckets instead
	of just 4.  Rounded all of the numbers for display or transmission
	instead of truncating.

2001-07-14 14:08  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Yet another rain fix.

2001-07-14 13:44  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Added some temporary debugging output to help get rain
	totals fixed.

2001-07-14 13:41  we7u

	* src/db.c: Increased height of Station Info dialog to accomodate
	weather info without scrolling.

2001-07-14 03:34  we7u

	* src/: main.c, wx.c, wx.h: More tweaks to rain totals.

2001-07-14 02:41  we7u

	* src/: main.c, wx.c, wx.h: Fixes for WX rain data.  Necessitated
	by the fact that wx200d daemon doesn't send us regular updates.  We
	now call compute_rain() from main.c:UpdateTime() on a regular
	basis, which keeps the rain queues cycling the way we need them to.

2001-07-13 17:02  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Minor:  Changed one debug message.

2001-07-13 16:54  we7u

	while.

2001-07-13 04:26  we7u

	* src/: db.h, wx.c: Another re-do of the weather rain code.

2001-07-13 03:04  we7u

	* src/util.c: Tweak to the upper limit for height in PHG
	calculations.  Spec says there _is_ no upper limit.

2001-07-13 03:02  we7u

	* src/: festival.c, interface.c, lang.c, maps.c, popup_gui.c: Minor
	spelling adjustments.

2001-07-13 02:53  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: More doc changes by Reuven Gevaryahu,
	KB3EHW.

2001-07-12 17:30  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Another tweak to help with debugging rain code.

2001-07-12 17:29  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Tweaked weather code to display out-of-range values as
	r..." or similar.  This should help me to figure out what's wrong
	with the rain code.

2001-07-12 16:00  we7u

	* src/util.c: More fixes to PHG.

2001-07-12 15:54  we7u

	* src/: draw_symbols.c, util.c: Some parameter checking for phg
	stuff.

2001-07-12 13:27  we7u

	* src/util.c: Corrected compressed mode pre-calculated radio range,
	as suggested by John Williams, VK5ZTY.

2001-07-11 12:15  n7tap

	* src/db.c: if (debug_level & 2) for area object printing.

2001-07-11 11:07  n7tap

	* acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure: Fixed problem with first
	call to Magick-config

2001-07-11 11:03  n7tap

	* src/datum.c: After email from Peter Dana, set WGS 72 to 0,0,0

2001-07-11 01:57  we7u

	* src/db.c: More bulletproofing of raw GPS string decoding
	routines.

2001-07-11 01:54  we7u

	* src/gps.c: A slight bit of bulletproofing for the GPS serial
	decode routines.

2001-07-10 20:17  we7u

	* src/db.c: More bulletproofing for GPGGA/GPRMC/GPGLL decoding.

2001-07-10 20:13  n7tap

	* ChangeLog, README.1ST, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	src/datum.c, src/datum.h, src/maps.c: Added Terraserver
	photographic map support.  Required the addition of lat/lon to/from
	UTM translation and while I was at it, I added datum translation
	ability directly to Xastir so we should be able to lose libproj
	soon.  To use Terraserver maps, set it up like for tiger maps: make
	a .geo file with the keyword TERRASERVER.  Also allowed searching
	for .fgd files in a "Metadata" directory relative to the directory
	with the geoTIFF map.  Also turned off 2 anoying printings:
	shapefile loading and wget.

2001-07-10 19:34  n7tap

	* acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure: Improved ImageMagick support
	finding.  As far as I know, versions above 5.2.0 should be good.

2001-07-10 17:24  we7u

	* src/db.c: We now just skip altitude if it's whacko in MIC-E
	packets, but process the rest of the packet.  Altitude would just
	not be reported.

2001-07-10 17:04  we7u

	* src/: db.c, xa_config.c: More bulletproofing for GPGGA decode. 
	Disabled some annoying debug messages in xa_config.c we probably
	won't need for a while.

2001-07-10 01:58  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h: Fixes a buffer overflow error when getting into
	negative or overly large altitudes.

2001-07-09 15:04  we7u

	option.

2001-07-09 14:54  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixes to prevent whacko altitude in MIC-E packets from
	causing segfaults.  The errant packets are now dropped.

	(rain).

2001-07-06 14:15  we7u

	* README.1ST, help/help-English.dat: Updates by Reuven Gevaryahu,
	KB3EHW.  _Very_ minor changes by we7u.

2001-07-06 04:25  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Simplified the rain totalling code again.  Fixed an
	incorrect constant that signified 10 inches of rain.

2001-07-04 13:40  dk7in

	* config/language-English.sys: 
	Show digis that echo my transmission.

2001-07-04 13:39  dk7in

	Beautifying an entry

2001-07-02 15:47  n7tap

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Added in range checks to draw_area

2001-07-02 15:39  dk7in

	* src/db.c: 
	Enhanced color selection for dots in trails.

2001-07-01 14:04  dk7in

	* config/language-English.sys: 
	Exporting tracklogs to file.

2001-07-01 13:55  dk7in

	* src/: db.c, main.c, util.c, xastir.h: 
	Exporting tracklogs to file.

2001-06-30 23:25  kg4ijb

	* src/main.h: adjust tocall -> 1.0.2

2001-06-30 07:38  we7u

	* src/wx.c: More robust wind gust and hourly rain calculations.

2001-06-30 05:50  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Some cleanup to the rain totals code.

2001-06-29 19:40  n7tap

	* config/xastir.rgb, src/color.h, src/db.c, src/db.h,
	src/draw_symbols.c, src/draw_symbols.h, src/main.c, src/xastir.h:
	Added preliminary support for drawing area objects.  The only ones
	I know for sure how to draw are boxes and lines.  I have not
	received information from the aprsspec list on how to handle
	circles, ellipses and triangles yet.  The filled boxes and the
	already existing ambiguity box are now being drawn with a stipple
	pattern instead of an | or whatever math operation.  This does a
	better job of transparency.

2001-06-29 17:38  ke4nfj

	* src/: db.c, fcc_data.c, fcc_data.h, main.c, rac_data.c,
	rac_data.h: Allow FCC & RAC data to be added while XASTIR is
	active.

2001-06-29 17:17  we7u

	nicely.

2001-06-29 13:35  we7u

	concern rain.

2001-06-28 19:34  we7u

	* src/wx.c: More weather fixes.  The one-hour rain total is now a
	rolling total over the last hour, instead of resetting to zero at
	the beginning of each hour.

2001-06-28 18:37  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Fixes to compute_rain().  More to come.

2001-06-28 17:48  we7u

	functions.

2001-06-28 11:52  we7u

	* config/: language-Dutch.sys, language-French.sys,
	language-German.sys, language-Italian.sys, language-Spanish.sys:
	Fixing up some field specifiers to match the weather fixes
	submitted yesterday.  --we7u

2001-06-28 07:30  dk7in

	* src/db.c: 
	Showing trail points in trail.

2001-06-28 04:08  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys, src/db.c, src/list_gui.c,
	src/maps.c, src/wx.c, src/wx_gui.c: More weather fixes.  Hundredths
	of an inch are now shown as such.  --we7u

2001-06-27 19:08  we7u

	* configure, configure.in, config/language-English.sys, src/wx.c:
	Weather fixes.	Bumped rev number up to 1.0.2 also.  --we7u

2001-06-27 15:27  we7u

	* src/db.h: Minor tweak preparing for more accuracy in total rain. 
	--we7u

2001-06-26 16:37  we7u

	* src/: main.h, maps.c: Added the capability of snagging history
	data from findu.com.  Create a .geo file with "FINDU" as one line,
	and "CALL we7u-12" (or whatever call you wish) as the second line,
	select that map, and Xastir will grab two weeks of data for that
	callsign from findu and import it as if it were a logfile.  --we7u

2001-06-26 14:50  we7u

	* src/: bulletin_gui.c, db.c: Now check for null pointers before
	checking string length on input parameters.  --we7u

2001-06-25 14:40  ke4nfj

	* ChangeLog: Initial Palm map support.

2001-06-25 14:37  ke4nfj

2001-06-19 02:24  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Still whittling away at Shapefile support for weather
	alert maps.  Not there yet, but closer.  --we7u

2001-06-18 17:22  we7u

	* src/: main.c, interface.c: More fixes for too many open sockets. 
	--we7u

2001-06-18 14:59  we7u

	* src/interface.c: An attempt to fix the "too many open sockets"
	problem.  Close an interface before opening a new connection. 
	--we7u

2001-06-14 16:40  n7tap

	* src/db.c: Fix so that extract_speed_course does not attempt to
	decode the area object extension which can look exactly like it. 
	What differentiates it is the symbol \ with l is used for area
	objects.

2001-06-14 13:02  n7tap

	* src/draw_symbols.c: Empirically changed the value to make the
	radius of the circles more correct.  For a little more info see
	post to xastir-dev.  --N7TAP

2001-06-12 13:10  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, draw_symbols.c, main.c: Fixed up "my_station"

	* src/alert.c: Update comment to describe alert_tag.

2001-06-09 15:31  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys, src/main.c: Added another mouse menu
	item for "Object -> Modify", and changed "Create New Object" to
	"Object -> Create".  Added a separator line also.  This new menu
	item doesn't really do anything new.  It's just another entry point
	into the Station Info dialog, but is easier to find in the menus
	when you wish to modify an item.  --we7u

2001-06-09 14:59  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Got rid of extra linefeed when writing
	transmitted data to log files.	--we7u

2001-06-09 14:51  we7u

	* src/: interface.c, main.c: More Object stuff:  If the Object
	dialog is up and we choose Modify Object from the Station Info
	dialog, it kills/recreates the Object dialog so that the data gets
	filled in.  Also added logging into the TNC and INET log files for
	objects my station transmits, as long as those logging options are
	enabled in the menus.  --we7u

2001-06-09 13:50  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys, src/db.c, src/db.h, src/main.c:
	Improved Object menus.	Delete button is gone from Create Object
	menu, Modify Object menu now fills in ALL parameters from original
	object, including lat/lon.  Create Object menu comes up with empty
	or default values for all.  --we7u

2001-06-09 02:01  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys, src/db.c, src/db.h, src/main.c:
	Working "Modify Object" changes.  If Station Info dialog is brought
	up on and object, the "Send Message" button changes to "Modify
	Object", which brings up the "Object" dialog when pressed and
	allows changes to be made.  --we7u

2001-06-08 20:23  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys, src/db.c: The beginnings of adding
	object->modify stuff to the Station Info dialog.  --we7u

2001-06-08 17:29  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Placed new code at better location in routine. 
	Appears to work well now.  --we7u

2001-06-08 15:58  we7u

	* src/interface.c: Mod which lets us listen to our own packets,
	display objects without interfaces being up, etc.  --we7u

2001-06-08 13:56  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys, config/language-French.sys,
	config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/db.h,
	src/draw_symbols.c, src/draw_symbols.h, src/main.c, src/main.h,
	src/xa_config.c: Support for RNG0000 (a hardcoded range instead of
	PHG).	   This may not be quite the correct radius at the
	moment...  Change to draw station in center of ambiguity instead of
	at one corner.	Support to draw a sorta tinted rectangle that
	represents the ambiguity.  Support to enable/disable ambiguity
	drawing.  Changes submitted by Olivier Calle, N7TAP --we7u

2001-06-07 19:48  we7u

	* src/maps.c: More on weather alert shapefiles.  Not functional
	yet.  --we7u

2001-06-07 19:46  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Added some comments.  --we7u

2001-06-07 03:03  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Adding comments to alert map code.  --we7u

2001-06-07 01:16  we7u

	* src/wx.c: Removed some unsigned long casts where the readings
	could be negative numbers.  --we7u

2001-06-06 14:14  we7u

	* config/language-English.sys, config/language-French.sys,
	config/language-Spanish.sys, src/db.c, src/db.h: Add ITEM
	capability and some metric tweaks for Festival.  Changes submitted
	by Olivier Calle, N7TAP.  --we7u

2001-06-06 14:12  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Tweak to Shapefile routine:  Closing file descriptors
	I left open.  --we7u

2001-06-05 18:00  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added labels for rivers, roads, lakes for Shapefile
	maps.  Shapefile maps now have all the basic functionality.  --we7u

2001-06-05 15:44  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Another shapefile tweak.	Now draws polylines closer
	to the edge of the screen.  --we7u

2001-06-05 14:55  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Color tweak for Shapefiles.  --we7u

2001-06-05 13:33  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Fixes for shapefile polygons.  --we7u

2001-06-05 04:04  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Shapefile road maps, lakes, and streams improvements.

	--we7u

2001-06-04 03:01  we7u

	* src/maps.c: More shapelib tweaks.  --we7u

2001-06-02 21:46  we7u

	* src/maps.c: MUCH more functional polygon shapefiles.	Now skips
	the entire file if none of the shapes are in the viewport, skips
	shapes if they're not in the viewport, and draws polygon shapefiles
	properly.  --we7u

2001-06-01 16:35  we7u

	* src/main.c: Small tweak to make a slackware compiler do the right
	thing.	--we7u

2001-06-01 11:48  we7u

	* src/maps.c: An attempt at fixing up the color problems with
	ImageMagick libraries between various systems.	--we7u

2001-05-31 17:01  we7u

	* src/maps.c: And some more...	(visuals stuff).  --we7u

2001-05-31 16:58  we7u

	* src/maps.c: More debugging info for X Visuals.  --we7u

2001-05-31 16:46  we7u

	* src/maps.c: More code added:	Getting ready for Shapefile weather
	alert maps, but not implemented yet.  Added debugging output for
	computing X Visual display class, to help in getting the colors and
	color_depth right for ImageMagick.  --we7u

2001-05-30 10:50  ke4nfj

	* src/: main.c, main.h, xa_config.c: Add Festival Speech for New
	Weather Alerts.

2001-05-29 12:22  we7u

	and adds more debugging info in other places.  --we7u

2001-05-24 16:01  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Minor change to allow multiple users to use the same
	ImageMagick temp file.	Not a good solution long-term, but useful
	at this point.	--we7u

2001-05-24 10:38  ke4nfj

	* ChangeLog: [no log message]

2001-05-24 10:35  ke4nfj

2001-04-09 00:00  we7u

	* src/: festival.c, interface.c: Removed casts to uint32_t in
	interface.c and festival.c.  They were causing problems on Redhat
	5.2 compiles, and really were only there to fix up some lclint
	errors.  --we7u.

2001-04-08 23:56  we7u

	* src/: db.c, main.c, main.h: Fixed Station Chooser dialog (part of
	Station Info heirarchy if there were multiple stations near the
	mouse pointer).  It now closes after choosing the first station,
	and the Station Info dialog then displays.  This fixes the bug
	where a second station could not be chosen in that dialog.  --we7u

2001-04-08 02:51  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixed the Send Message dialogue so that it only shows
	packets to/from my local station in the window.  If I want to see
	ALL packets to/from my station, I can put in my own call and it'll
	show them to me.  --we7u

2001-04-08 02:00  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, main.c, maps.c, messages_gui.c: Changed back to
	GXor bit-blitting for the weather alert maps (I'll make up my mind
	one of these days).  Fixed the clear-messages button in the send
	messages dialogues.  To do this I added a force parameter to the
	update_messages() function.

2001-04-06 18:18  we7u

	* acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure: Fixed spelling error

	messages_gui.c, popup_gui.c, track_gui.c, view_message_gui.c,
	wx_gui.c: More lclint bugfixes.  Getting tired of the same old
	messages day after day? --we7u

2001-04-05 15:13  we7u

	* src/: bulletin_gui.c, db.c, interface_gui.c, location_gui.c,
	main.c, messages_gui.c, view_message_gui.c, wx_gui.c: More lclint
	bugfixes.  Nothing major.  --we7u

2001-04-05 14:12  dk7in

	* src/: db.c, db.h, locate_gui.c, track_gui.c, util.c, util.h: 
	Strict AX.25 call checking, but allow some additional internet
	names now.  Don't change my position if heard via APRS (position
	ambiguity problem).  Start immediate redraw after file loading. 
	Don't reload map at tracking start if not neccessary.

2001-04-05 03:40  we7u

	* src/main.c: Fixing the names of the forms widgets properly now
	for the Configure Station dialogue.  --we7u

2001-04-05 03:14  we7u

	* src/main.c: Changed Configure_station dialogue back for the
	moment 'cuz it was screwed up.	Something wrong with the code for
	it.  I'll fix it later.  --we7u

2001-04-04 20:37  we7u

	* src/lclint.script: Added some more flags to get rid of warnings
	that don't matter.

2001-04-04 20:36  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Added an lclint annotation to get rid of another
	lclint error.

	* FAQ: Additions/corrections by Reuven Gevaryahu, KB3EHW.

2001-04-04 17:15  we7u

	* src/: db.c, gps.c, wx.c: Segfault fix:  We were getting
	concatenated packets, usually onto the end of MIC-E packets.  These
	caused instant segfaults when the decoding routines tried to store
	longer-than-normal data into dynamicaly allocated temp storage
	space on the stack.  I increased the size of the variables in db.c
	and gps.c, and corrected some spelling errors in wx.c.	--we7u

2001-04-04 15:55  we7u

	* acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure: Pretty'ing up some of the
	configure messages so it's clear what's actually going on.

2001-04-04 15:08  we7u

	* acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure: Small change to acinclude.m4

	libraries unless all three are present.

2001-04-04 14:34  we7u

	* help/help-English.dat: Changed Xastir version in the help file

	infect the rest of the data.  --WE7U.

2001-04-03 03:19  we7u

	* src/: db.c, util.c, util.h: Added util.c:makePrintable()
	function, which gets rid of ALL characters below 0x20 (space) and
	above 0x7e (").  This is to be used whereever a printf is used that
	might send unusual characters to the console where Xastir was
	started.  Added this function to a few places in db.c that needed
	it.  Did not go through every printf in all the modules to see
	where else it might be needed.	--we7u.

	Should be more platform independent.

2001-03-18 08:22  we7u

	* src/main.c: Made the Map Chooser buttons language-independent. 
	Moved the buttons around slightly to make it harder to choose the
	"Vector Maps" button by mistake while clicking on map files.

2001-03-18 03:31  we7u

	* src/alert.c: Added some comments.  Lot's of them.

2001-03-18 03:21  we7u

	* src/main.c: Implemented zooming via PageUp/PageDown keys, panning
	via arrow keys.  at the level it is implemented though it appears
	to be responding to keycodes directly, so it's probably going to be
	dependent on IBM keyboards.  Hey, it's a start.

2001-03-17 04:44  dk7in

2001-03-15 03:06  we7u

	* src/db.c: Fixed some problems in decode() where after an
	strncpy() call, there is no terminating zero in the string.  That
	should clear up data corruption problems with weather alerts,
	messages, and objects, perhaps others.

2001-03-15 00:15  kg4ijb

	* src/view_message_gui.c: malloc call in all_message().  This

	window (interesting).

2001-03-14 18:31  we7u

	* src/db.c: First attempt at fixing corrupted messages due to
	buffer overruns.  Added "+22" to some of the strncpy statements
	(easy to grep for), which severely helped.  Current problem left is
	that the "{FARAC" strings at the end of the NWS messages end up in
	the weather alert window as well.  This is a much more minor
	problem that what we had before.

	* Makefile.am: Modified to create empty directories in
	/usr/local/xastir that might be needed later (like maps, Counties,
	fcc, and sounds).  In order to get "make install" to create these
	directories I also made a "placeholder" file that gets copied into

	ax25 from being compiled in, use --without-ax25

2001-03-10 00:18  kg4ijb

	* acconfig.h: added WITH_AX25

2001-03-09 16:14  we7u

	* src/: main.c, maps.c, maps.h: Added parameter to map draw
	functions to specify which pixmap to draw into (pixmap or
	pixmap_final).	pixmap is now reserved for drawing map data into. 
	Weather alerts, symbols and tracks are drawn into pixmap_final. 
	This speeds up display updating tremendously.  If no zooms or pans
	have occurred, normal operation is to leave pixmap alone, so the
	program doesn't have to go back and read the map files at that
	point.	It merely copies the map data already in pixmap to
	pixmap_final, draws weather alerts, symbols, and tracks into it,
	then copies that to the display.

	with overlays - Updated English and German language files - I
	started to put something into the FAQ - Angle for symbol rotation
	is now +/- 30 degrees instead	of +/- 45 degrees from North or

	trail lines between points   more than one degree apart.  Trail
	also will not cross the   180W/180E boundary (the world grid
	doesn't wrap anyway).  - A station is declared to be "moving" after
	two valid positions   are seen.  - No longer reloads from map files
	if not changes are necessary   during zoom/pan.  - Maximum zoom
	centers the world grid and no further zoom-out	 is possible.  -
	Zoom factor on status line is updated AFTER the map reload  
	instead of before.  -- Rolf Bleher, DK7IN

	Bleher, DK7IN

2001-02-27 18:56  we7u

	* src/: db.c, db.h, draw_symbols.c, main.c, maps.c, maps.h: Changes
	by DK7IN: ----------------- - Changed tracking of stations. Until
	now the map was updated at every   beacon received from the tracked
	station. I had serious problems   getting any access to the system,
	because it was busy with the map   updating process, and that could
	need more time as between received   12sec intervall beacons. Map
	drawing should be a separate thread...
	
	  Now the map is updated only if the car leaves the inner area of
	  the map, the margin is set to 1/6 screen on each side.
	
	- The first trail point was always missing, it was not stored.	 
	Works now.
	
	- Selecting a new trail color only for moving stations. And fixed a
	  problem with reinit of the current trail color at the wrong
	place.	  Now the trail colors come in sequence.
	
	- Until now EVERY new station got a color, now only mobile stations
	  get their colors (at a different place).
	
	Changes by WE7U: ---------------- - Modified map grid routines to
	write to pixmap_final instead of pixmap.    This is to keep the raw
	map image pristine so that we can use it from	 then on for quick
	screen updates (as long as no zooming or panning    is occurring). 
	Removed draw_grid() calls from load_auto_maps() and    load_maps()
	functions, added it to create_image(), redraw_symbols(),    and new
	refresh_image() functions.
	
	- Added refresh_image() function, which starts from "pixmap" map
	data   and refreshes symbols, tracks, etc to the screen.  Does NOT
	go back   to the maps on disk to do so.  Called from Grid_on() and
	Grid_off()   routines currently.  I hope to replace create_image()
	with it in   the UpdateTime() function at some point.  If the
	Zoom_level() function	is eventually made to ignore panning, I'll
	add it where we are selecting	the same zoom level as we're
	currently at.

	station   coordinates after initialisation. The problem had to do
	with using   of '.' as a separator in the first call and ',' in the
	second call   of the same routine. Later it seems to be '.' again.
	Some sort of   internationalisation problem, but with changing
	values during program	execution. I have not found the reason for
	this behaviour but did a   workaround without using atof(). I hope
	there are not more such   problems at other places.  --Rolf Bleher,

2000-12-31 13:06  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Added tweaks to help remove a bit of the black
	border, turn black pixels within a very short distance of the
	border to white (again helps to visually remove the border), and
	added a "brightness" variable that can adjust the brightness of the
	map colors from 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (full normal brightness).  If
	someone wants to add a menu option in for this at some time I'll
	tie the menu option to the variable to give full control of map
	brightness to the operator.

2000-12-29 03:24  we7u

	* src/maps.c: Totally re-written "draw_geotiff_image_map" function.
	 Old functions are present and called by default.  New functions
	are called with the -v2 debug flag on the command line.  Re-write
	is fast, requires very little memory, merges USGS topo maps
	together nicely.

2000-12-26 17:06  ke4nfj
